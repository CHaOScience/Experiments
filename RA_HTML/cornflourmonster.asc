Explanation

Explanation: 

Description taken from Dave's write-up on the Naked Scientists website:

cornflour monster] [1]

This is a really strange effect only discovered about 6 years ago.
Basically it involves shaking cornflour mixture very hard and it starts
to grow tendrils, in a very 1950's B-movie way.

I waterproofed a 100W RMS speaker using a silicone spray, and then drove
it using a signal generator via an amplifier. I then filled the cone
about a third full with cornflour (cornstarch) mixture and turned on the
power.

At about 30Hz (this depends on how much water you put in the cornflour)
as I turned up the power it starts to change shape.

Small holes start to form which then grow until they meet one another
and then it forms tendrils which grow and reform.

[[what-is-going-on]]
What is going on?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cornflour is a shear thickening liquid which means that it gets stiffer
as you apply forces to it.

This means that it will flow better when it is being pushed gently then
when it is being pushed hard.

Normally if you have a liquid with a slight bump in it then gravity will
cause the liquid to flow from higher areas to the lower.

However if you vibrate the cornflour hard enough, at some parts of the
cycle it will accelerate downwards at more than 10ms-1, this means that
the cone is pulling the cornflour downwards, the opposite of the normal
situation when it is pushing the cornflour up. This means that the
cornflour is left behind and will flow in the opposite direction out of
the hole.

When the cone accelerates upwards the forces due to the acceleration add
to gravity creating a force large enough to stiffen up the cornflour so
very little liquid flows into the hole. However when the cone is
accelerating downwards the forces are much less so it becomes less stiff
and the mixture can flow out of the hole easily. So overall the mixture
flows out of the hole and it grows.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Cornflour and water mix in a washing up bowl.

|RISKS |1. Powder may trigger asthma attack. +
 +
2. Minor slip hazard. +
 +
3. Irritant to eyes. +
 +
4. After a while, the mixture accumulates some dirt, which is not
recommended for consumption.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Clear up spilt powder. Where
possible, do the experiment outside. Do not allow children to help to
mix in new powder without first checking that they do not suffer from
asthma. +
 +
2. Clear up spills promptly; if the floor is smooth, ensure that a mop
is +
available for this. +
 +
3. Avoid contact with eyes. Ensure that eye-wash is available near the
experiment. +
 +
4. Encourage children to wash hands after use.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. Move child out of
area and sit them down. Call first aider. +
 +
2. Call first aider in event of injury. +
 +
3. Call first aider. Allow parent to rinse with eyewash supplied if
desired; a demonstrator must not do this themselves unless trained to do
so.

assessment.
