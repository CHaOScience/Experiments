                    <p>The audience enter the time-ship Geologise! and prepare to travel back in time with the presenters, one of whom has already been back in time (or that's what he says at least...) Unfortunately, the ship doesn't manage to time travel so they have to use the study of rocks to understand what happened millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Relative Dating:<br />
Use layers of play-doh and different coloured sand in a tank to show the principles of stratigraphy - that layers of sediment form one on top of the other. Show how different processes can happen to the sequence of rocks to perturb the original stratigraphy, and the techniques used to unpick the chronology. Possibly inject a coloured liquid to a layer underneath to show how igneous rocks can cut across others. Show faulting (cut the play-doh using a blunt knife) and folding in the sequence to show how rocks can be offset at the surface. Get a toy dinosaur from the toy box (throwing the other soft toys carefully out behind them) and get a member of the audience to make footprints in the play-doh layer of the stratigraphy, and show how they can be preserved. Talk about unconformities and the concept of 'missing time' in relation to Hutton's Unconformity. The sand can also show varying sedimentation rates.</p>
<p>Absolute Dating:<br />
All well and good being able to tell which rock was laid down first, but what time exactly did the rock form. Explain radiogenic isotope dating and the concept of half-life. Give the audience (shown on the screen with a camera, or a small group of children at the front) a piece of paper with a different colour on each side and get them to hold it up. Get half of the room after a certain amount of time to turn the cards over, and then half of the remaining group, and so on. The number of one colour relative to the other shows how old something is.</p>
<p>Different Environments:<br />
The various layers of play-doh and sand can represent different rock formations found in a sample area (such as Arran, show the geological map) and each one captures a different environment. The Devonion Old Red Sandstone with large pebbles in a sandy matrix formed from an arid environment with river systems (show samples). The Carboniferous mud and coal deposits formed in a tropical environment with many trees and large insects like the myriapod (show the myriapod footprints and what can be deduced about the myriopod from this, think about fossil preservation in general). The Permian New Red Sandstone formed in a desert environment with occasional storms (show the fulgurite formed by lightning, get a child to feel the inside of it to show it has fused, shows the sandstone formed above ground).</p>
<p>The talk concludes with the point that you don't need to travel in time to work out what happened millions of years ago, and in fact it is more useful to look at a whole series of rocks laid down over a long period of time as it shows how things changed, rather than just a single snapshot. All this is summarised in a song play on the keyboard and sung in harmony: Geology's like travelling in time...</p>
