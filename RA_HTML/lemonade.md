Freezing Lemonade in front of your eyes
=======================================

<span class="submitted">Sun, 15/08/2010 - 10:17 — mnd22</span>
Introduction
Freezing lemonade by lowering air pressure.

Explanation
Explanation: 

Cool down lemonade to about -5°C in an ice salt bath and then open the lid. As you do so it will freeze. This is because you reduce the number of solutes in it by letting the CO2 come off increasing the melting point, it also creates lots of bubbles which can act as nucleation points for the ice.

Risk Assessment
Risk Assessment: 

Cooling Lemonade to -5°C and then opening it to cause it to rapidly freeze.

RISKS
-Slip Hazard if you drop the ice water mix on the floor
-Cold, but anyone would take their hand out long before it did any damage
-Faint possibility of a bottle exploding if it froze hard, and had lots dissolved gasses in it and it was damaged

CONTROL MEASURES
-Clean up Spills
-Don't let sealed bottles freeze hard

IN EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT
- Call first aider
