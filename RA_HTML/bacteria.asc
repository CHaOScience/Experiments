Introduction

Understanding bacteria with agar plates

Old URL: 

http://www.chaosscience.org.uk/dem/public_html//article.php?story=20060309103310980

Useful information

Kit List: 

*NB: None of this stuff currently exists +
- Agar plates with 4 different types of bacteria (lab attenuated, of
course!) +
- Pictures and posters on walls. +
- Easy-to-use slide viewers with pictures of bacteria in them (v suited
to small kids) +
- Microscope and gram-stained bacteria and yeast slides (v suited to
older kids). +
- Goodies for kids!

Explanation

Explanation: 

Bacteria can be very exciting and this experiment should help kids to
understand a bit more about what we mean by "germs".

*** OVERVIEW ****

A display of different bacteria and how they interact with us!

Possible activities: +
1. Verbal explanation - what are germs? +
1. Looking at colonies on the Petri dishes. Agar, differences between
colonies. +
2. Looking at the slides. Bacteria are small. +
3. Verbal explanation of the displays. Diseases and harmless/useful
bacteria.

Other things to talk about: +
- General discussion on bacteria/germs/viruses/microbiology.

Tips for demonstrating: +
1. Follow the risk assessment to keep control of the bacteria and
slides. +
2. Find out what each display is showing. Visitors expect YOU to know
everything on the board/slide/Petri dishes. +
3. Be prepare to challenge misconceptions: e.g. All bacteria are bad for
you; myths about GM organisms, etc.

*** BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION ***

One way to go about teaching this might be to start with asking kids
what we mean by germs - I imagine the word "bacteria" will come out
eventually. Where are bacteria? All over the place, especially on our
food, in our tummies, on the floor when it's not been cleaned with
bleach etc.

Then look at the colonies - ask what the kids think they are. Do they
see colonies in their house? Probably not like these. Agar is great
food, so that's why we see so many bacteria. We use agar to see the
colony size and shape, which tells us lots of info about what sort of
bacteria we are looking at. Can they describe colonies? (colour, size,
shinyness, shape)

Now, we can also look at individual bacteria, which are really small.
Most are minute, usually only 0.5-5.0 μm in their longest dimension,
although giant bacteria like Thiomargarita namibiensis and Epulopiscium
fishelsoni may grow past 0.5 mm in size. 5 micrometres means that 200 of
them could fit into 1 mm. That's why we can't see them. So we can use
microscopes to look at them.

Pictures of many different species of bacteria are on display. Many are
disease causing and you can talk about the diseases they cause. Don't
forget to mention that most bacteria are harmless to human (even though
there are hundreds of pathogenic species of bacteria, but compare that
to the total number of species of bacteria - many thousand million
species as estimate.). Some bacteria are good for you: Lactobacillus in
probiotics, for example. Your normal flora have can prevent pathogens
from colonising, produce vitamin K, help digestion.

*** OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ***

General microbiology.

Gram staining and ways to distinguish between different bacterial
species.

Bacteria that live in extreme environments.

consideration of transport.*

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION a|
Colonies of micro-organisms in petri dishes (these will be some/all of
the following): +
 +
1. Micrococcus luteus (On Nutrient agar) +
 +
2. E. coli K12 (On Nutrient agar) +
 +
3. Janthino lividum (On nutrient agar) +
 +
4. Neurospora crass (fungus, one nutrient agar +
 +
5.. 'Good bacteria' from brand A bioyoghurt drink (On chocolate agar) +
 +
6. 'Good bacteria' from brand B bioyoghurt drink (On chocolate agar). +
 +
8. Staphylococcus aureus (On Blood agar) +

Slides of many micro-organism, Gram stained, mounted onto slides (these
will be some/all of the following): +
 +
1. Staphylococcus aureus +
2. Streptococcus pyogenes +
3. Clostridium tetani +
4. E. coli +
5. Salmonella +
6. Corynebacterium +
7. Bacillus +
8. Candida albicans +
 +
Also, "biovewers" - simple to use "microscopes" with the experiment for
looking at bacterial slides. Wall-mounted poster display.

|RISKS a|
1. Sharp edges of slides may present cutting risk. Slide may be dropped
and the broken glass may also present cutting risk. No risk from
organisms fixed on the slides as the staining process would have killed
the cells.

2. Electrical equipment - hot and risk of electrocution if faulty.

3. Accidental exposure of micro-organisms/blood agar if Petri dishes are
broken/stolen/lid removed.

4. Risks of infection during sample preparation (pre-event).

5. Risks of infection after event due to incorrect disposal.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Ensure that the demonstrators are well briefed about the potential
risks and keep a close eye on Petri dishes. Children are not allowed to
handle the Petri-dish or slides. Sign should be on display saying "Don't
touch! Live bacteria." Demonstrator to ensure that a sharps bin is
located nearby to dispose of slides should they break.

2. Switch off microscope between uses if it starts to become hot. Ensure
experiment is not near a watery experiment.

3. Secure the pathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus, and both yogurt
cultures) Petri dishes (which are sealed with parafilm) onto a display
board with clear plastic laminate that goes over the plates, and makes
them very hard to run away with. Venue safety officer to ensure "safe"
micro-organsisms are used -
http://www.microbiologyonline.org.uk/forms/Safe.pdf [1] will help.
Non-pathogenic (#1-4) organisms must still be sealed in parafilm, and
secured with string to the table; however, these do not need to be
covered in plastic laminate.

4. Standard lab procedures to be obeyed. The person preparing the agar
plates must have had experience in working with bacterial plates.

5. Demonstrator must not throw old petri dishes into the bin. Petri
dishes must be autoclaved after use (the dishes can be left in a tied up
petri dish/biohazard bag for 2 days max until they can be brought to an
autoclave). Venue safety officer to ensure these provisions are in
place.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1. Wash any small cuts with soapy running water. Compress and elevate
large cuts. Call a first aider. If an agar plate was broken, cordon off
area, remove glass/plastic, clean area thoroughly with disinfectant and
alcohol. Warn parents to watch the cut and to attend GP or A+E if there
is a change in appearance to the wound which they think is odd, eg. pus
or lots of redness.

2. Switch off electric equipment in event of an electric accident, call
a first aider, give the casualty space. In the event of a burn, hold
area under cold water for at least ten minutes. Call a first aider.

3. See 1.

4. See a GP if symptoms develop which the person thinks may be related
to preparing the plates.

5. Inform department if plates have been erroneously disposed of, try to
relocate plates in order to autoclave them.
