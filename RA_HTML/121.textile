Explanation:

<div class="field-items">

<div class="field-item odd">

**In a nutshell**\
You and the children play with the gooey cornflour/water mix, exploring
the concepts of solids, liquids and substances that have properties of
both.\
Cornflour is lots of irregular shaped particles that are separated by
water normally so are lubricated and can move. If you squash them
together it will push the water sideways a little bit and let them touch
- now they lock together and behave as a solid.\
The picture shows cornflour under a confocal microscope, which takes a
2-D slice through an image rather than looking at the surface.

**How to set up the experiment**\
Slowly add water to cornflour until it works - ask a committee member
for help if you're getting stuck. A ratio of 2.5 parts flour to 1 part
water is suggested, but the ratio may vary.

**What you need to know about the experiment**\
(1) Cornflour is shear thickening. This means the higher rate of shear,
the higher the viscosity (i.e. the thicker it is). (Note: Shear can be
explained by considering 'layers' of cornflour particles sliding past
each other.)\
(2) Try asking them whether it is a solid or a liquid. You may want to
get them to come up with definitions of the terms solid and liquid -
e.g. "what do we call hard things / things that flow...?" Cornflour is
like a solid and a liquid - Acts as a solid under stress and a liquid
otherwise\
(3) It's like a room full of people and when you try and make it move
quickly, everyone tries to move at once (while also moving closer
together) and they all get in each other's way and so no one can move
anywhere. And when you do stuff to it slowly, everyone has time to move
out of the way and file out.

[\[2\]]{.print-footnote})

**Want to know more?**\
Shear thickening is a problem in the oil industry, as when they are
drilling they are getting rock fragments in the mud coming back up, if
there are too many they behave similarly to the cornflour, with
catastrophic results to pumps.\
Some people are talking about making [liquid body
armour](http://www.dcmilitary.com/army/pentagram/9_17/national_news/28729-1.html)
[\[3\]]{.print-footnote} using this effect, to make the body armour more
comfortable.\
The opposite of shear thickening is shear thinning. Many substances are
shear thinning because the higher rate of shear can break up
interparticular interactions and reduce the viscosity - e.g. shampoo,
toothpaste - when you shear them by squeezing them out of the tube, it
flows, but when there's no shear, it sits quite happily on the
toothbrush without flowing anywhere.

**Explanation warnings**\
THICKENING SOUPS IS DIFFERENT: the cornflour grains open up when heated
and release long starch molecules that tangle together forming a
gel-like substance.\
THIS IS NOT THIXOTROPY, which is concerned with time related effects.
Thixotropy is a long word and shouldn't be used with children. Adults
should be politely and gently explained the difference! The longer you
shear a thixotropic fluid the lower the viscosity (the thinner it
becomes) - e.g. paint - as you progressively break up interparticular
interactions. Many fluids that are shear thinning are also thixotropic.
Rheoplexy / Anti-thixotropy is the opposite - i.e. the longer you shear
a fluid the higher the viscosity (the thicker it becomes). Xanthan gum
might do this under certain conditions, but it's very rare for
substances to do this.
