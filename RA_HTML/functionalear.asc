Explanation

Explanation: 

We are building (c. 2005) a functional model of the ear, it should have
an eardrum, the appropriate little bones to take the sound to the
cochlear. The coclear will be unwound and instead of complex things
happening with fluids it will consist of a series of wires with
different resonant frequencies, so when you play different notes into
the thing, different wires will resonate. This is not a bad
approximation to what really happens.

Risk Assessment

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Model of Ear to show how hearing works

|RISKS |Resonant wires could be quite sharp

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |Design it so you can't apply much
force to the wires (some sort of cover over the top) +
 +
Try and blunt the ends somehow

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
case of injury
|=======================================================================
