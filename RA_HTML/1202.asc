Explanation

Explanation: 

*In a nutshell:* +
Use the handheld glucose meter to test the glucose concentration of
different solutions (in place of blood). Many children will know someone
who has diabetes but may not have had the chance to look at the
equipment they use. Use this opportunity to let them investigate, and
talk about the different types of diabetes and how it affects
lifestyle. +
*How to set up the experiment:* +
Make up bottles of a variety of glucose concentrations using the
syringes to measure out 100mM stock solution for dilution. Aim for
solutions with concentrations of approximately 2 (hypoglycaemic), 5
(normal fasting), 7(normal post-meal, diabetic fasting), 12 (diabetic
post-meal) and 25 (approaching ketoacidosis). I normally only use two
different solutions though to conserve the testing strips (a normal one
and a diabetic one). You may then wish to hide the numbers on the
bottles, depending on how you wish to demonstrate! +
Talk about diabetes in general. Use the charts to explain how blood
glucose varies throughout the day and how this differs in diabetes. You
could then get the children to choose one glucose solution and test the
concentration, then work out what situation this reading is likely to
have arisen in. You could also talk about the pancreas, its role in
regulating glucose levels, and the actions of insulin and glucagon (this
may also lead on to a discussion about hormones). +
*USING THE METER* - this is very simple. Press the large on button and
insert a new single-use test strip. Apply a tiny drop of solution to the
end of the strip – not on top of the flat part, but poking the thin end
into the droplet so it can be drawn in to the capillary. It may be
easiest to do this by placing a small droplet of the solution onto the
child’s (clean – this isn’t going to work if they’re covered in
chocolate) finger/back of hand and then poking the test strip in to it
as if it were a real drop of blood.

*Background information:*

*Diabetes Mellitus* (from Wikipedia) +
Diabetes mellitus, or simply diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases
in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the pancreas does
not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the
insulin that is produced. This high blood sugar produces the classical
symptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst)
and polyphagia (increased hunger). The cause of the polyuria is simply
osmotic diuresis – the glucose content of the blood is so high that it
cannot all be reabsorbed by the renal tubules and thus glucose is
excreted in the urine. This increases osmotic pressure in the tubule,
causing retention of water and thus high volumes of urine. +
There are three main types of diabetes mellitus (DM). +
Type 1 DM results from the body's failure to produce insulin, and
currently requires the person to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump.
This form was previously referred to as "insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus" (IDDM) or "juvenile diabetes". +
Type 2 DM results from insulin resistance, a condition in which cells
fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute
insulin deficiency. This form was previously referred to as non
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or "adult-onset diabetes". +
The third main form, gestational diabetes occurs when pregnant women
without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a high blood glucose
level. It may precede development of type 2 DM.

*Type 1 diabetes* +
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss of the
insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the
pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency. This type can be further
classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic. The majority of type 1
diabetes is of the immune-mediated nature, in which beta cell loss is a
T-cell-mediated autoimmune attack. There is no known preventive measure
against type 1 diabetes, which causes approximately 10% of diabetes
mellitus cases in North America and Europe. Most affected people are
otherwise healthy and of a healthy weight when onset occurs. Sensitivity
and responsiveness to insulin are usually normal, especially in the
early stages. Type 1 diabetes can affect children or adults, but was
traditionally termed "juvenile diabetes" because a majority of these
diabetes cases were in children.

*Type 2 diabetes* +
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance, which
may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion. The defective
responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the
insulin receptor. However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes
mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type 2
diabetes is the most common type. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor
associated with 'lifestyle' problems such as obesity.

*Diabetic Emergencies* +
People (usually with type 1 diabetes) may also present with diabetic
ketoacidosis, a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by the
smell of acetone, a rapid, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing,
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and altered states of
consciousness.

*Diagnosis* +
Fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) +
Plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dL) two hours after a 75 g oral
glucose load as in a glucose tolerance test +
Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l (200
mg/dl)

*Pancreas* +
The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine
system of vertebrates. It is an endocrine gland producing several
important hormones, including insulin and glucagon which circulate in
the blood. Insulin is a peptide hormone, produced by beta cells of the
pancreas, and is central to regulating carbohydrate and fat metabolism
in the body. It causes cells in the liver, skeletal muscles, and fat
tissue to absorb glucose from the blood (thus lowering blood glucose
levels). Glucagon is a peptide hormone secreted by the pancreas that
raises blood glucose levels. Its effect is opposite that of insulin.

*Treatment* (from diabetes.org.uk). Insulin is used to treat type 1
diabetes, and only used in type 2 diabetes when other, non insulin based
treatments, have failed. +
There are six main types of insulin: +
• Rapid-acting analogues can be injected just before, with or after food
and have a peak action at between 0 and three hours. They tend to last
between two and five hours and only last long enough for the meal at
which they are taken. They are clear in appearance. +
• Long-acting analogues tend to be injected once a day to provide
background insulin lasting approximately 24 hours. They don't need to be
taken with food because they don't have a peak action. They are clear in
appearance. +
• Short-acting insulins should be injected 15–30 minutes before a meal
to cover the rise in blood glucose levels that occurs after eating. They
have a peak action of two–six hours and can last for up to eight hours.
They are clear in appearance. +
• Medium- and long-acting insulins are taken once or twice a day to
provide background insulin or in combination with short-acting
insulins/rapid-acting analogues. Their peak activity is between four and
12 hours and can last up to 30 hours. They are cloudy in appearance. +
• Mixed insulin – a combination of medium- and short-acting insulin. +
• Mixed analogue – a combination of medium-acting insulin and
rapid-acting analogue. +
Historically, people would have taken two doses of short-acting insulin
and had to tailor their diet around it, eating specific quantities of
food at specific times. Now, most people take a long-acting insulin once
per day and then rapid acting insulin every time they eat, calculating
the dose against the amount of carbohydrate in their food. This means
more injections, but much greater freedom in eating.

*What about insulin pumps?* +
These are increasing in popularity. They are small electronic pumps
which are clipped to the waistband and have a narrow tube with a small
plastic cannula inserted into the subcutaneous tissue in the abdomen
(this set is changed every few days). They allow a constant infusion of
insulin with ‘boluses’ added at the press of a button on eating. They
allow freedom in choice and timing of food, but some people find them
restrictive because of the tubing and the device clipped to the belt.

*Is this the same as an ‘artificial pancreas’?* +
Not quite – it’s sort of half of one! The aim of an ‘artificial
pancreas’ is to monitor blood glucose levels and respond to this by
alteration of insulin infusion – i.e. a closed unit where the user does
not have to have any input themselves and without having to do
finger-prick blood glucose tests. One of the major difficulties in this
is devising a way of monitoring glucose levels in the body.

*Can’t we test real blood?* +
No! Good opportunity to talk about blood-borne diseases, blood and
sharps safety.
