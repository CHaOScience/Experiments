Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^

First get them to try and roll the flat wheels along the straight rails
- it is just about possible if they are careful, but when they try on
the curved track there is nothing keeping it on the rails...

Then maybe try the convex wheels, they should work a lot better. this is
because when it goes slightly wrong to the right the left hand wheel
effectively gets smaller, and the right hand bigger

So it will tend to turn left back into the track.

Then get them to try the blue convex wheels, these have the opposite
effect if it goes wrong, the change in size of the wheels makee the
problem worse...

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |The effects of various wheel edge profiles on cornering is
investigated.

|RISKS a|
1. Finger trap between the track and wheels

2. Dropping one of the sets of wheels on a finger

3. Finger trap between base and the ground

4. Stray wheels may roll away causing a trip hazard

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Ensure tracks are clear before testing a set of wheels.

2. Carry sets of wheels with both hands.

3. Try not to leave or let kids lean on the floor by the tracks whilst
wheels are being investigated.

4. Catch wheels at the end of each round of testing; don't allow them to
roll away unsupervised. Keep a track of each of the four sets of wheels,
and if one is missing, locate it before continuing the experiment.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
case of injury.
