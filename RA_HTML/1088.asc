INTRO/BACKGROUND: The following is an example of what the leader might
say +
during the introduction, including some specific questions to keep the
kids engaged. It +
does not need to be repeated verbatim, and probably will contain more
information that is +
necessary to explain. +
Can anyone describe what learning is? Scientists like to say that
“Learning is the way we +
acquire information about the world”, but this can mean a lot of things,
information can +
mean things like phone numbers, friends names, times-tables, but it can
also be things +
like friends faces, how to make a free throw, or how to draw a picture.
When scientists +
over the last century have thought about learning, they realized
something very +
important, and that is that some kinds of learning are require conscious
activity and +
others happen unconsciously, and they refer to these kids of learning as
explicit and +
implicit learning. +
Consciousness can be tricky to talk about, maybe you think you know
exactly what we +
mean by conscious and unconscious activity, but lets look at it a
different way. If we +
asked you to describe how you learned that 6*8 is 48, you could probably
describe how +
math works, that if you took a bunch of M & M’s and made a square with 6
rows of 8 +
M&M’s each that you could count each one and make 48. Some things that
we learn are +
easy to talk about, but others are more difficult, take free throws for
example, somebody +
probably showed you how to hold the ball, but how exactly do you know
how to make +
the shot? +
Scientists look at it this way, times tables and correct free throws are
both kinds of +
information that can be learned. The type of information that you can
easily think about +
and describe is termed explicit \{think explained-explicit}, and the
kinds that you kind of +
just do are termed implicit \{less easy to remember, think implied}. Now
in everyday life +
not everything fits nicely into one category or the other, but for today
we’re going to stick +
with that definition.

When you learn something new individual cells in your brain change. One
thing that +
scientists are currently studying is where in your brain specific cells
are changing. +
Were going to show you a little game that will change a few cells in a
part of your brain +
called the cerebellum. One thing that your cerebellum helps you do is
compare what you +
see with what your body is doing. You have lots of sensors in your
muscles that keep +
track of where your body is. If you move your arm, you know where it’s
moving even if +
you cannot see it, or aren’t paying attention. A copy of this, along
with a lot of other +
information goes to your cerebellum. +
Your cerebellum helps you by comparing what you want to do with what you
actually +
did. So if you’re playing a beanbag toss game, and you throw a beanbag
at a target then +
you either hit the target or miss the target. Part of your cerebellum is
working like a little +
computer, and each time you throw a bag, it keeps track of how close you
were to the +
target. It takes the information about how much you missed the target by
and uses it to +
change the way your arm moves the next time you throw. +
When you play the beanbag toss game, were going to move where the target
appears to +
be, so you will end up throwing it further away from the target than you
would expect, +
but if you take enough throws your cerebellum will do the work for you
and change the +
way your arm moves without you even having to think about it. And your
throws will get +
closer and closer.

ACTIVITY: Volunteers will lead groups of 4-6 students. Students will be
trying to throw +
a beanbag into a target. Each student will first get an opportunity to
practice a few throws +
and then they will be given a pair of Prism Goggles. Prism Goggles
distort the field of +
vision to about 20 degrees in one direction and make it very difficult
to hit the target and +
beanbags will probably be thrown all over the place. Other students that
aren’t +
participating can help collect stray beanbags. While wearing the
goggles, each student +
should get 20-30 attempts to hit the target. Students should be
encouraged at this time to +
“let their brains adapt to the situation” rather than manually adjusting
where they aim +
(many students will attempt to adjust their aim). After they begin to
consistently hit the +
target, ask the student to remove the goggles and throw again. Many of
the students will +
accidentally miss in the opposite direction. Some students may not show
these effects of +
compensation. Allow each student to have his turn to wear the glasses
and try the +
experiment.

DISCUSSION: Once we put on prism goggles, there are two ways to adjust
and hit the +
target. One strategy is explicit, we tell ourselves that our aim is off
and try to throw the +
beanbag where we think the target is, rather than where it appears. This
type of strategy +
quickly adjusts our performance, but requires us to guess where the
beanbag should be +
thrown. For students that use this strategy, when the goggles are
removed, and they are +
asked to throw again, they will not experience an opposite shift in
their aim. When using +
the implicit learning strategy we throw the beanbag where the target
appears to be. This +
strategy requires several attempts, each time we throw a beanbag, our
brain makes a tiny +
adjustment, in a brain circuit that we do not have conscious control
over. The adjustments +
last for a while which is why after removing the prism goggles, our aim
has been adjusted +
in the opposite direction, and takes a few more trials to re-learn.

Some questions to ask \{feel free to add your own}: +
Is one kind of learning better than the other? \{each have their own
benefits, think about +
the attention demands of explicit learning} +
What is an example of an activity that is more effectively learned
implicitly/explicitly? +
\{maybe something like soccer/friends names} +
Why would we want to learn things without having to pay attention to
them? +
Are there any subjects in school that are best learned implicitly?
\{foreign language}

Risk Assessment

Date risk assesment double checked:

Risk assesment double-checked by: 

Mattlem

Risk Assessment: 

RISKS: +
1. Child becomes disorientated wearing goggles or on removing them and
is more likely to fall over. +
2. Small objects being thrown towards target escape and present a trip
hazard +
3. Small objects to be thrown towards target hit other people.

MITIGATION: +
1. Ask child to stand still on one spot if they are wearing the goggles.
If they feel dizzy, remove the goggles and tell them to sit down on the
floor. Do not allow them to run around wearing the goggles. Remember
that they may be equally disorientated on removing the goggles - do not
allow them to run off immediately and again make them sit down if they
are dizzy. +
2. Keep an eye on the whereabouts of the objects, do not get too many
out at once. Where possible, use objects such as beanbags which will not
bounce and roll all over the floor. +
3. Do not allow children to collect objects while the subject is still
throwing them. Position the experiment so that other people are not in
the firing line. Use soft, light objects where possible.

ACTION IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT: +
1, 2 and 3. Call first aider if necessary.
