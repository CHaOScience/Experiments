Explanation

Explanation: 

\1. Connect the red wire on the LCD to a fork and the black wire to a
zinc plate. Secure wires in place with adhesive tape. +
2. Get another fork and zinc plate and connect them with the connection
wire using adhesive tape. +
3. Insert the forks and zinc plates into the lemon halves to activate
the LCD watch movement as shown in the diagram. You will see your watch
start blinking.

How does it work? +
The forks act like the positive electrodes of a battery. They are plated
with a metal which is less reactive than zinc. When the forks and zinc
plates are inserted into the lemon, a chemical reaction takes place.
Electrons (extremely small particles with negative charge) move from the
zinc plates to the forks to form a current, thus activating the LCD
watch. The lemon juice helps to conduct electricity. You can replace the
lemon with a potato, a grapefruit or use soft drinks and see what effect
this has.

Fun Facts +
The development of the battery started in 1775 when a scientist called
Alessandro Volta invented a machine that produced and stored static
electricity by rubbing cat fur across a metal plate. A few years later,
a doctor called Luigi Galvani noticed that dissected frogs' legs
twitched when they were in contact with two different metals. Volta
realized that the electricity came from the metals and began doing
experiments with different types of metal. In 1800, he made the first
ever battery which consisted of copper and zinc strips separated by a
piece of paper soaked in salt water and dipped in diluted acid.

Extra points to get across... talk about circuits a bit, why does it all
have to be connecting in a circuit, how does the electricity travel
through the fruit!

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Description build fruit battery and explain relevance to
circuits and fuel cells.

|RISKS |1) Fruit juice getting in eyes +
2) Fruit juice getting in cuts

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1) Encourage metal rods to be put
carefully into fruit to prevent squirting of fruit juice +
2) Clean rods between use so not covered in juice when children handling
them

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1) Call first aider in
event of incident. Use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and
confident to do so. +
2) Wash affect area with cold water.
