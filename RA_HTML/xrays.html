                    <p><img src='http://www.chaosscience.org.uk/sites/default/files/xrays.jpg' alt='Photo of X-rays in use' /><br />
- General - What is it?  Do they know when are they taken (when someone might have a fracture) and where?  Asking whether they know anyone who's had one or had a plaster cast can be a good way to get their attention/persuade them that you are not a child-eating ogre.  </p>
<p>How do x-rays work?  you can talk about the production of X rays to older kids - it involves very high voltages across metal releasing photons which travel along and get stopped by things which are dense and/or which have high molecular mass (this is why calcium shows up, and explains blood being somewhat radioopaque because of its iron content - you can see blood in the heart, and you can also visualise it on CT scans, which are just X rays taken at loads of different levels and cunningly put together).</p>
<p>Smaller kids will appreciate something a bit like light which can go through softer things eg. skin but not harder things eg bone, metal implants.  Of course then explaining a barium enema can be tricky, but you could describe it as "special liquid which can be seen on X rays".</p>
<p>- Ask lots of questions, get them to work out what everything is for themselves (our skeleton can help with this). If they're young it will probably take them half an hour to work out what they're looking at.</p>
<p>- Legs - which way up? Broken bones - Why do the kids think we take different views?-, kneecap, hip joint, bone growth can be discussed if they look clever, with the views we have of immature bones, which are still cartilagenous at the epiphyseal growth plates.</p>
<p>- Chest - heart, lungs, diaphragm, collarbone, ribs </p>
<p>- Putting stuff into body to see on x-rays -intestines, arteriograms (not everything in your body is a vein…), why have arteries </p>
<p>- Skull-compare with skeleton, what you can see, eyes, nose, mouth, teeth, sinuses</p>
<p>- pathological X-rays are great, especially to talk about hip replacements and whatever fun pathologies there are!</p>
<p>Basically, you can go through the x-rays however you like and develop your own spiel, but as it's one of my favourites I thought I'd write down roughly what I do!</p>
<p>-Start with talking about why you might have an x-ray.<br />
-Ask them how x-rays are made. I talk about a 'special kind of light' (if they're older, you can start talking about the electromagnetic spectrum, especially if they've had a look at our UV and IR experiments) that can go through soft bits of the body but not hard bits like bone.<br />
I get them to tell me what they would see behind me if I stood with a big light in front of me and a wall behind (my shadow). So then what would you see if they shone x-rays at me instead (a shadow of just my bones - you can talk about x-ray film here too if you like).<br />
-What are bones for? (support, locomotion, protection - see Skeleton explanation)<br />
-Skull x-ray - why do we have big spaces in our skull? (decrease weight)<br />
                  - why do some of the teeth look different? (fillings - can talk about x-rays not passing through metal)<br />
-Chest x-ray - identify the bones (ribs, clavicles, spine)<br />
                     - identify the organs (big spaces are air-filled lungs, the thing in the middle is the heart - they're always amazed by how low and central it is)<br />
                      - but I said x-rays go through soft bits? What is the heart made of? How can we see it on the x-ray? Actually, x-rays can't go through metal. Do bones have metal in them? (calcium - they usually know this or will get it with prompts about why you should drink milk to keep your bones strong) What is the heart full of? (blood) Does blood have metal in it then? (iron - they may not know this. If you like you can then talk about iron and haemoglobin and red blood cells - there are lots of tangents to go off in on this experiment, depending on what they're interested in!)<br />
-Hand and foot x-rays - did they know they have so many bones in their foot? Compare their hands to Boris if he's nearby.<br />
-Arm angiogram - two things you can do with this: talk about the angiogram and contrast medium etc. If doing this, compare with the barium enema. Alternatively, this radiograph is clearly of a young child - large spaces between metacarpals/phalanges, few carpals visible. Can compare to adult hand x-ray and talk about calcification, can even relate to foetal skull, especially if the model is within reach. There is a radiograph of the pelvis which is also of a child, the growth plates in the femur are clearly visible so you can compare them and talk about how space between the bones is needed for growth and you can judge the age/developmental level of a child from an x-ray.<br />
-Pelvis - see above for growth plates. Yes, it is male (always gets some giggles if they spot the shadows!)<br />
-Double contrast barium enema - I usually describe this as a late stage barium meal - cheating I know, but no-one's picked me up on it yet! Compare with the angiogram and talk about how we can use contrast media to see things otherwise not visible on x-rays.<br />
-Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreaticogram (ERCP) - at least I think that's what it is. To be honest I usually hide it. If you are capable of explaining it in a manner comprehensible to small children, please let me know and update this explanation!<br />
-Humerus with screws - get them to work out what the screws are, talk about how some breaks are so bad/misaligned that pins and screws are needed to realign the bones.</p>
<p>MRI images<br />
-First point - these images were donated by a committee member, so they are not anonymised as all the radiographs (which are teaching images) are. This is fine - you just might need to know as we have in the past had members of the public tell us off for using identifiable images, but it's ok as we do have full permission!<br />
-I usually only go on to these with older/interested kids.<br />
-Start by asking if the images look different to the radiographs. Ask if they've heard of MRI scans/seen people on TV going into those big scanning machines. Get them to work out what part of the body you're looking at, and that it's like you've sliced across the spine in two different directions. Point out that you can see soft tissues. Talk about why this might be more useful than an x-ray (you can see more than just the bone in fine detail!)<br />
-My explanation of MRI is a bit rough: the machine contains an extremely strong magnet. This makes all the water molecules in your body line up in the same direction like lots of little magnets (they may have played with compasses in magnetic fields at school). The machine then fires radio waves at the body. This knocks all the little spinning water molecules slightly out of line, but a different amount out of line depending on the environment of the molecule (i.e. where it is). When the radio wave is turned off, the molecules all flick back to where they were in the magnetic field, releasing energy. This energy release is captured by sensors and turned into an image. </p>
