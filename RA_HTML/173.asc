Explanation

Explanation: 

Here is a hopefully not too ropey write-up of what is an awesome
experiment (I hope you won’t string me up with all these puns)! You
start with the contraption up and the bag containing 4 filled 2 litre
water bottles out loose

*The bag*

First, get the kids try and lift the bag, and then like a Christmas
turkey get them to guess the weight. Wild guesses will ensue. Tell them
there are 4x2l bottles in the bag. Ask them how heavy 1l of water is.
(Wild guesses). Tell them that 1kg = 1l of water. Then get them to tell
you how heavy the bag is (4x2=8 is surprisingly difficult). 8kg of
weight is how heavy the bag is (or 80N downwards), so how much force do
you need to apply to lift it slowly? Just over 8kg worth of weight (or
80N). I think we have bagged that idea, let’s move on. Maybe say that as
far as you pull down, the bag lifts up, as it maybe is useful to say
that at this point so they are thinking of it…

*First Pulley*

Put it on to the pulley that looks like the first picture in figure 1 (I
know the diagram isn’t great, but I am not artistic and was using
paint). Ask them how much weight is pulling down (8kg/80N), then ask how
much force you need to lift it up (just over 8kg/80N), then ask how much
one rope must pull up to lift it (just over *8kg/80N*). Get all people
to lift weight (try and get everyone to do it, so they appreciate the
change in other pulley system). _Make sure you are holding on to the leg
opposite pulley one, or else it will shift across the floor_.

*Second Pulley*

Move the bag on to pulley two. Before you get them to lift it ask how
many ropes are there _(ensure the one you pull it with is pulled out to
the side so they don’t mistakenly count it – there should be two of
them)_. Then ask them how much weight is pulling down (8kg/80N), then
ask how much force you need to lift it up (just over 8kg/80N), then ask
how much one rope must pull up to lift it (just over *4kg/40N*). Get all
people to lift weight (try and get everyone to do it, so they appreciate
it is easier to lift). Some may spot that you have to pull it twice the
length to get it to lift the same amount of distance (don’t worry if
they don’t yet).

*Third Pulley*

Move the bag on to pulley three. Before you get them to lift it ask how
many ropes are there _(ensure the one you pull it with is pulled out to
the side so they don’t mistakenly count it)_. They will say 3 or 4
usually, so then say no and ask them to actually count. It is 5 taking
the weight. Then ask them how much weight is pulling down (8kg/80N),
then ask how much force you need to lift it up (just over 8kg/80N), then
ask how much one rope must pull up to lift it (this is a bit trickier -
just over *1.6kg/16N*). With the first person, ask them to hold the
rope, and walk backwards, and keep on going, keep on going, keep on
going. They realise now how much more rope you have to pull. Thus you
can now discuss how to lift it the same distance, you must do the same
work, so in total put in the same amount of force. Thus as the force is
less, you have to go further (5x the distance). Get all people to lift
weight (try and get everyone to do it, so they appreciate it is much
easier to lift).

*Closing Comments*

Whilst everyone else is having a go at the Third Pulley, ask them if you
had a very heavy weight, which system is better (some will say first
here as you have less far to pull – this is incorrect as very heavy
things you couldn’t pull). The answer is three – easiest to do work.
Therefore you use two and three to help you lift heavy weights. So what
is the point of 1 then? Get lots of answers about how it is easier to
carry, and you then point out to them that it doesn't change the weight
they are carrying. What it does is that it changes the direction in
which you are pulling, so you are pulling downwards. You can also ask
them which system did they use the most energy while lifting. The answer
is that it doesn't matter which one you use, you will expend the same
amount of energy. This is because the height you lifted the weight
through was the same for all three systems; it doesn't matter whether
you pulled with a large force and moved the rope a small distance (first
pulley), or whether you pulled with a small force but moved the rope a
large distance (third pulley).

*Appendix*

You want more? You must be pulleying my leg. For advanced people, you
can talk about why a pulley system with an odd number of pulleys may be
beneficial (as in fig. 3) as it allows the user to pull down, using
their weight to their advantage. With an even number (fig. 2) you'd have
to pull up, which is harder. You may also want to explain uses of
pulleys getting cargo out of ships etc... how would you use them to move
a heavy weight horizontally, whilst keeping it off the floor (or out of
the sea!)... you could talk about components here and forces pulling
against each other etc.
