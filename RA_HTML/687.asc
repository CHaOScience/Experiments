Introduction

Public summary: 

You'll often see these model cells helping to explain other biology
experiments, but one day they may get their own solo careers...

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

Box of model cells

Useful information

Kit List: 

3 x model cells in small blue box

Frequency of use: 

3

Explanation

Explanation: 

Model cells can help to explain that the units of living things are
cells. (You can explain this by saying that a living things is made out
of cells like a house is made out of bricks).

The box contains 3 model cells:

• “Cushion” model cell, showing various organelles, including wool for
DNA in the nucleus. (This cell was made by Isobel and Lara before
2010). +
• Inflatable animal cell, showing various organelles (includes laminated
sheet of notes) +
• Inflatable plant cell, showing various organelles (includes laminated
sheet of notes)

These cells are often used with microscopes and kiwi DNA, and can be
split between a number of different biology experiments at an event.

## Some biology to talk about (copied from the experiment Microscopes &
Cells) ## +
- Cells are very small (typically 10 um for an animal cell... that's
1000 times smaller than 1 cm (you can use the ruler to show 1 cm) +
- Cells are analogous to a building brick - houses are built of lots of
bricks, like people are built of lots of cells (50-75 trillion!) +
- Cells aren't just bricks - they are alive, and make things, use
things, and process information +
- Have a phospholipid membrane – barrier to extracellular environment +
- Nucleus is the ‘control centre’ - contains instructions on how to make
proteins, from which the rest of the cell is made. Instructions are
written in a 4-letter code on very long molecules called DNA (see Kiwi
DNA experiment). DNA to mRNA (transcription), transported out of
nucleus, translation on ribosomes to proteins. Proteins go to the ER
(endoplasmic reticulum) for further folding, then to Golgi apparatus
(more modifications), then on export pathway to exit the cell. +
- Cells need energy - this is supplied by mitochondria (they convert
energy from sugars into ATP, the energy currency of the cell) +
- Plant cells - cell walls and chloroplasts (we have a root tip squash
slide where the cell walls are visible and the nuclei are nicely
stained, but they don't have chloroplasts because it's a root. If they
want to see more plant cells, there's a whole demo on plants...) +
- Bacteria are also cells, but they are smaller and don't have a nucleus
(associate bacteria with disease e.g. food poisoning caused by E. coli).
Bacteria can be lots of different shapes (look at E. coli,
Staphylococcus, Spirillum).

Risk Assessment: 

DESCRIPTION: Model cells

RISKS +
1. Trip hazard if dropped on the floor +
2. Risk of injury to demonstrator blowing up inflatable model cells

ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS +
1. Keep all props in contained area +
2. Demonstrators with respiratory conditions should avoid inflating
cells

ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT +
1.Call first aider in case of injury
