Useful information

Kit List: 

Bridge Base (flat board and two triangular pieces, they attach together
with wing nuts) +
5 Blocks (all the same) +
2 wooden supports (scaffolding to assist the building process)

Packing Away: 

Take the base apart by undoing the wing nuts that hold the triangular
pieces to the base. Store them by reattaching to the triangular pieces.

Explanation

Explanation: 

*** OVERVIEW ****

This is an arch bridge built of 5 identical blocks, which the children
can then walk over.

Possible activities: +
1. Build bridge. +
2. Walk over it.

Other things to talk about: +
Forces on blocks.

Tips for demonstrating: +
The blocks are quite heavy for small children, so you may need to lift
them for them/get parents to help. Don't let them jump on the bridge/too
many on at once - jumping off sideways may cause the bridge to fall to
the side, too many children on at once may push each other off.

*** BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION ***

To build the arch bridge, get the children to place the wooden supports
between the ends of the bridge, then get them to add the blocks,
starting at the ends. If they have trouble working out which way round
to put the blocks try showing them the trapezium shaped side of the
block. Ask them whether the longer or shorter side needs to go on top to
make the arch shape.

Check that the blocks are all lined up straight and that the tops of the
blocks all meet. Ask them what will happen when you take the wood away -
will the bridge stay up? Why?

Take the wood away - the bridge stays up! Talk about how the shape of
the brick means that they are being squashed in from the sides ('in
compression') and they can't fall down. Ask if they think the bridge is
strong enough for them to walk over (subtly check that the bridge is
sturdy first) - take care that they don't fall when they do this.

When the child is standing on the middle of the bridge, ask them what is
stopping them from going straight down. Depending on the child's age,
could talk about the force of their weight, and explain how it is pushed
out sideways and that it is because the ends of the bridge cannot move
away from one another that they don't fall down.

Explain that this is how real arch bridges work - the mortar 'gluing'
the bricks together isn't very important, all the strength is due to the
bricks being squashed together horizontally. Bricks are strong in
compression, but no good in tension.

It can be useful to ask the children how the other blocks would have to
move to allow one of the blocks to fall, to get them to see the arch as
a lot of wedges jammed in between the piers. Very wide stone arches have
a tendency to force apart their piers and collapse.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|EXPERIMENT |Build a bridge out of the blocks then walk across it.

|RISKS a|
1. Dropping Blocks on feet

2. Falling off bridge

3. Blocks getting smooth over time and slipping against each other

4. Bridge falling over sideways

5. Being hit by carried bridge scaffolding

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Blocks are designed to be fairly light and covered with rubber.
Demonstrators may need to help younger children carry the blocks.

2. Make sure that the bridge is erected somewhere the floor is flat,
with no sharp corners to fall on. Don't let kids jump up and down on the
bridge (both because the blocks can slip and the child can fall off).
Children should only go on the bridge one at a time. Don't let children
crawl under the bridge.

3. Blocks should be checked for smoothness at the beginning of the
event. Demonstrator should remain vigilant for blocks slipping during
the event.

4. Demonstrators should test the bridge by walking over it before any
children do. Children should not be allowed to jump off the bridge
sideways, as this may cause the bridge to fall.

5. Small or overexcited children should be supervised when moving bridge
scaffolding.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1. Call first aider in event of injury

2. Call first aider in event of injury

3. Demonstrator must stop experiment if they suspect that the blocks are
getting smooth. Call first aider in event of an emergency

4. Call first aider in event of injury

5. Call first aider in event of injury
