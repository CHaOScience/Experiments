                    <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
<p> The precise format of the workshop will need to be adapted on the day depending on ambient conditions (e.g. lighting), visitor age/ability, etc. The committee member in charge needs to be familiar with the robotics kits and have ideas for tasks of varying difficulty, so they can choose the best option on the day.  A rough description is detailed here, with a few basic ideas for tasks.</p>
<p>3 visitors will be allocated to a robot kit each. Robots are pre-built, or significantly pre-built, in a configuration suitable for the task used in the workshop. Visitors may have some opportunity to select sensors used or motor layout, but the core sections of the robot will be provided.</p>
<p>Each group will be given a task to achieve by the end of the session using their kit. Tasks can range from simple drawing robots, to more complex tasks, such as carrying objects to specified locations. The task will be decided based on speed of progress and understanding, with extensions possible. Initially, example code will be provided and demonstrators will explain how to control and program the robots effectively. Demonstrators will also assist in any changes or additions to the physical structure of the robots, and advise on potential programming techniques or strategies to use. In previous years the challenge has been to move around a loop.</p>
<p>We found that giving all groups the task of moving the robot forward, turning, and returning to the start is a good way to gauge ability and explain the basics of how the programming environment works. Once the basics are understood, conditional loops (if, while) and using sensor readings should be explained briefly, perhaps by showing the first stage of a solution (pre-prepared by volunteers), and the visitors should be allowed to develop their own solutions for the problem. If children are struggling at any point, volunteers should explain the pre-prepared solution and help the children program it, but only for the sections they are struggling with.</p>
<p>Teaching will focus on showing that computer programs are like recipes, listing actions in sequence, with conditional branches to account for variable situations. The programming will reinforce this by giving visitors a set of instructions in a drag-and-drop format, as ingredients for their recipe, which they must choose to obtain the desired result. It will be stressed that there are many ways to solve a programming problem, though some may be faster than others, and that it is critical to predict as many scenarios as possible, so they can be coded for. Finally, it will be explained that it is impossible to predict every eventuality, so the robot should fail gracefully if an unknown situation occurs, such as resetting or returning to the initial state. Graceful failure and error recovery is a slightly more advanced idea and volunteers should only discuss this with visitors if they are progressing well. In that case, the visitors can be given a task of implementing failure and recovery, and artifically causing errors (if it doesn't happen anyway) to test their error handling.</p>
<p>Potential Tasks: (increasing difficulty)</p>
<p>Plotter, using dead reckoning (robot holds a pen and draws on paper by moving)<br />
Dancing robot (robot performs some preset sequence of motions, multiple groups may co-ordinate to produce group 'dances')<br />
Line-follower with simple feedback<br />
Object sorter (when robot is given object from a given set, it detects the object and carries it to the correct destination)</p>
<p>There is also an option to run a shorter challenge. The software will be specially designed to make it even easier than usual to understand and program with. The task will be to write code to enable a robot to navigate its way through a maze through the use of touch and light sensors.</p>

<tr>
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>All visitors will be monitored regularly by demonstrators to ensure they do not swallow any lego. The robots are largely pre-built, minimising visitors' use of individual parts, and any modifications will be supervised by a demonstrator. Particularly young children will be supervised closely, though it is unlikely that very young children who may swallow parts will be present as the workshop is targeted at older children.</li>
<li>Motors are sealed in a robust manner, so any short circuits will result in a simple failure, with no risk to users. In the very unlikely event of an exposed short, voltages and currents used are very low (powered by 4 AA batteries), so present no significant risk to users</li>
<li>Motors are sealed, so hair is unlikely to be caught, though it may be caught by gearing systems. All visitors will be made aware of the risk and asked to ensure any dangling objects on their person are kept out of the way. They will also be made aware of the emergency stop, which will shut off all motors instantaneously</li>
<li>If at any time the robots are going to be left unattended, they must be put into a box to prevent children from using them while unsupervised</li>
<li>Robots should be used on the floor unless they are immobile or all children present are standing and have their heads above the edge of the table</li>
</ol>
</td>

<tr>
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>Immediately stop robot if anything is caught in motors. If short circuit occurs, power down the robot and do not use the kit further. Call a first aider if required, though risk here is minimal.  If any parts are swallowed, immediately call first aider.</li>
