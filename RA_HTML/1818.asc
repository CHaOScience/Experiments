*Dinosaur Dress-Up*

*Fossils and Replica Dinosaur Bones*

*Colouration of Dinosaurs*

*Description*

A ~30m scarf, colour-coded with each geological period. +
To covey sheer size of geological time, how long humans have existed for
and dinosaurs.

Audience volunteers unroll the scarf, stopping at key stages in
geological history.

Audience Volunteers don different items of clothing to ascertain how

Feather boa +
Fake Strap on Wings

For the use of demonstrator. Placed under the projector to display to

Tripping on feather boa

Possible choke hazard of feathers to small children

Dropping of fossils on feet

Falling on the floor and being a tripping hazard.

*Action To Be Taken To Minimise Risks*

Keep scarf off the floor to prevent tripping
