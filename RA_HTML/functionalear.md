Explanation
Explanation: 

We are building (c. 2005) a functional model of the ear, it should have an eardrum, the appropriate little bones to take the sound to the cochlear. The coclear will be unwound and instead of complex things happening with fluids it will consist of a series of wires with different resonant frequencies, so when you play different notes into the thing, different wires will resonate. This is not a bad approximation to what really happens.

Risk Assessment
Risk Assessment: 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Model of Ear to show how hearing works</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>Resonant wires could be quite sharp</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>Design it so you can't apply much force to the wires (some sort of cover over the top)<br />
<br />
Try and blunt the ends somehow</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td>Call first aider in case of injury</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
