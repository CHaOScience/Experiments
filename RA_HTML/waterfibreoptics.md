Explanation
Explanation: 

Borrowed from Dave's Naked Scientists explanation: [http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/water-...](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/water-fibre-optics/ "http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/water-fibre-optics/") <span class="print-footnote">\[1\]</span>

### In a nutshell

A stream of water is used to bend light and demonstrate how fibre optics work.

### What to do

1.  With the bottle empty, ask where they expect the light to go when the torch is switched on. Most will say in a straight line. Show them they are correct - it's useful to have a wall to point the torch at.
2.  Put your finger over the hole and fill the bottle up with water.
3.  Shine the torch through the bottle at the back of the hole.
4.  Remove your finger from the hole and move it down the stream of water, showing how the light no longer travels in a straight line.

If you can, put a short straw into the hole - you'll get a smoother flow of water than just through the hole alone.

You should notice a spot of light on your hand while it is in the stream of water even though it must have gone around a corner to get there. It tends to work best when the water comes out quite slowly.

### What you need to know during the experiment

To understand what is going on here it helps to do another experiment. Fill a transparent bowl with water, put something in the bowl and then look upwards at the bottom of water.

If you look at the bowl from the top you can see the spoon at the bottom.

Looking upwards in the bowl of water you see a reflection of the spoon at the bottom of the bowl in the surface. The water is behaving like a mirror.

So light will reflect really well off the inside surface of water at a relatively small angle.

This means that if you shine the light into a tube of water whenever it meets the side it is reflected so the light stays within the water until it hits your hand lighting it up. This happens even if the water goes around a corner.

### Want to know more?

### Why do you get such a good reflection from the surface of the water?

Light goes more slowly in water than in air and whenever light changes materials and the speed changes it will be bent (refracted). When it moves from a slow material (like water) to a faster one (like air) it is bent towards the surface.

### Optical Fibres

If instead of making the tube out of water you use very very pure glass and pull it to a thin flexible fibre, when you shine light in at one end it will come out of the other. By getting the right design of fibre the light can travel through up to 50 km of fibre and still be detectable. You can then send signals through the fibre by flashing the light on and off again a bit like morse code, and if you can flash the light very fast you can transfer huge amounts of information. The record is now (Dec 2011) nearly 200 gigabits per second down a long-distance optical fibre connection (<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16174972> <span class="print-footnote">\[2\]</span>). Because they are so good at transmitting data optic fibres move most of the data around the world (internet traffic, phone calls etc.) and you are almost certainly reading this via one.

If you make the tube out of plastic rather than glass it is more flexible and safer, and you can use it to make the artificial Christmas trees with the tiny pin pricks of light.

Risk Assessment: 

### DESCRIPTION

Pouring water out of a lemonade bottle with a hole in it shining a torch into it and looking at where the light ends up.

### RISKS

1.  There is quite a lot of water involved, so if a surface is vulnerable to getting slippery when wet it could be a slip hazard.
2.  If using the large bucket of water, note that it is very heavy to carry.
3.  Electric shock risk with water.

### CONTROL MEASURES

1.  If the floor is vulnerable to slipperiness, clear up any spills. It may be worth laying down newspaper in the area around the bucket.
2.  Take care when carrying the large bucket of water, and seek assistance if necessary.
3.  Electrical torch to be well insulated from water - protect bodywork and bulb area.

    ### IN CASE OF ACCIDENT

    Call a first aider.
