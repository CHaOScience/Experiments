Explanation

Explanation: 

*Intro*

This demonstration consists of a number of parts of fossilised Mesozoic
vertebrates. The aim is to talk a group through a number of different
animals alive during the Mesozoic – the era of the dinosaurs (Triassic,
Jurassic, Cretaceous, 250-65 million years ago). The experiment includes
several dinosaurs, marine reptiles, a fish, and a coprolite (fossilised
excrement).

At some point it is a good idea to ask children if they know what
fossils are and how they form. If they aren’t too sure, explain how hard
parts of animals – teeth, bones, shells – can be buried under layers of
sediments, and eventually become fossilised. However, plants,
footprints, tree sap and excrement can all be fossilised too. The fossil
we see may be as it originally was, it may have recrystallised, or it
may be an imprint. The details of fossilisation processes are actually
very complicated, but fortunately a general idea of what happens is
sufficient.

An awkward question I have been asked a few times is how do we know that
a given fossil is 80 million years old? This is a hard one to answer,
since most of the fossils are old enough to be dated using Uranium decay
series. If children are old enough to understand Carbon-dating, you can
make an analogy with this, otherwise you may have to make do with
talking about relative dating using layers of sedimentary rocks.

Children rarely get to see fossils up close, and when they do they are
usually behind a glass barrier in a museum. Please encourage them to
pick these specimens up, look at them, feel them, and engage as
scientists in trying to work out what they are! However, make sure they
are careful – we are borrowing these fossils from the Sedgwick Museum,
and I’d quite like to not have to take anything back in pieces.

You may like to talk about why there are no dinosaurs alive today. The
leading theory for the cause of their extinction at the end of the
Cretaceous is a meteorite impact, although some scientists favour
linking to a huge amount of volcanism in India which produced a vast
quantity of lava now known as the Deccan Traps. Either event would have
altered the climate by throwing up debris or ash into the air which may
have blocked out the sun, but the volcanism would also have greatly
increased CO2 levels, further contributing to rapid climate change.
Technically, you could argue that not all dinosaurs are extinct – birds,
which evolved from dinosaurs like Velociraptor during the Jurassic,
could be called dinosaurs.

You may also like to talk about the differences between herbivores and
carnivores: carnivores tend to have forward facing eyes for better depth
perception; herbivores have outward-facing eyes to spot predators.
Carnivores have sharp teeth to tear into flesh, herbivores have flat
teeth to grind up tough plants. This is covered in more detail in the
Animal Skulls experiment.

You may end up being asked the question “are these real?” Although they
are all from a museum, only some of these specimens are actual fossils –
the rest are casts of real fossils, so look exactly the same. You can
probably tell the difference in weight between casts and real fossils,
but I have included in the descriptions of the fossils which they are.

If children ask where these fossils are from, I am not exactly sure in
every case, but most were found (or are casts of fossils found) along
the coastlines of Dorset and NE England, as this is where cliffs of
Mesozoic aged sedimentary rocks can be found.

The rest of this guide consists of a description of each fossil with an
idea of what to talk about for each one. I like to take the pieces of an
animal out one by one, pass them round, ask questions about them to see
what the children can work out for themselves, and then tell them what
they are, and show them a picture if we have one. All of these animals
were alive during the Mesozoic, but not at the same time. Nevertheless,
this demonstration is intended to give children an idea of the sorts of
animals that were alive during this time, and of how we work things out
about those animals.

*Iguanodon* +
_126-125 million years ago (Early Cretaceous) +
Members of group Iguanodontia 156-65 million years ago (Late Jurassic –
Early Cretaceous)_ +
Iguanodons have had an interesting history of discovery. When they were
first discovered, only a few bones were found, including a spike.
Scientists’ best guess at this time was that Iguanodons looked like
giant iguanas with spikes on their noses (you can see this in statues in
Crystal Park). When a more complete skeleton was found, they discovered
that the spikes in fact were on their thumbs, and were probably used
either for defence or for foraging for food. The reconstruction was far
more like today’s, except that they were thought to stand on two legs,
since their back legs were slightly larger than their front legs.
However, (as can be seen in the Sedgwick Museum’s rather impressive
specimen) they had to break the bone in the tail to allow skeletons of
Iguanodon to stand like this. It was later proposed that these dinosaurs
used all four legs to walk, with evidence from footprints to back this
up. +
Iguanodons were herbivorous dinosaurs, roughly 10 metres long, with flat
iguana-like teeth. +
Fossils +
- vertebra, real +
- finger bone, real +
- tooth, real – an opportunity to talk about the difference between
carnivorous and herbivorous teeth +
- bone fragments x2, real – you may be able to see lots of holes where
the marrow used to be

*T-Rex* +
_67-65 million years ago (Late Cretaceous) +
Members of family Tyranosauridae 83-65 million years ago (Late
Cretaceous)_ +
Tyrannosaurus, or T-Rex, was a huge carnivorous dinosaur, measuring up
to 13 metres long, and chasing after prey on its powerful hind legs. Its
sharp teeth made easy work of prey, and its tiny arms may have been used
to grasp this prey and prevent it from escaping. Whether or not this is
correct, they were certainly not useless, as they have been shown to be
strong and muscled. T-Rex was most likely both a powerful hunter and a
scavenger. +
It has been suggested (e.g. Planet Dinosaur TV series) Tyrannosaurids
and Ceratopsians (horned dinosaurs like Triceratops) simultaneously grew
in size over the course of the Late Cretaceous to out-compete each
other, the Ceratopsians getting larger and improving their defensive
horns, and the Tyrannosaurs becoming bigger and more deadly. +
Since some early Tyrannosaurids have been shown to have “protofeathers”,
it has been suggested that T-Rex may too have had them. However, its
large size probably meant that they were unnecessary – like large
animals such as elephants today, they would not have needed any extra
coating such as feathers to stay warm enough. Still, perhaps they had
some remaining protofeathers rather than a full body covering? +
Fossils +
- Toe claw, cast +
- Tooth x2, cast – again, talk about how sharp teeth are useful for
carnivores +
- Brain case, cast – this is a cast taken of the inside of a T-Rex’s
skull, so shows the size and shape of its brain! Notice how it is
smaller than our brains, despite T-Rex being so huge! This shows that
dinosaurs like T-Rex weren't too bright.

*Baryonyx* +
_130-125 million years ago (Early Cretaceous) +
Member of family Spinosauridae 155-84 million years ago (Late Jurassic –
Late Cretaceous)_ +
Baryonyx is unusual in that it is thought to have eaten fish. It was
about 8.5 metres long, and had a long snout and sharp teeth to help it
catch fish. It was a member of a family of dinosaurs called
Spinosaurids, some of which had a large spiny frill on their backs, but
Baryonyx did not. +
Fossils +
- Toe claw, cast – this was probably used for hunting. Baryonyx means
“heavy claw”, but this refers to the claws on its front limbs, which
were useful for fishing.

*Dapedius* +
_Late Triassic – Early Jurassic_ +
Dapedius is a kind of fish that lived in the Mesozoic oceans. It had
armoured plates and fed on mussels and sea urchins. +
Fossils +
- Whole specimen, flattened, real – this fish's scales have been covered
in crayon by whoever borrowed it from the museum before us. It was
flattened by the weight of the layers of sediment that buried it as it
was fossilised.

*Plesiosaur/Pliosaur* +
_200-65 million years ago (Early Jurassic – Late Cretaceous)_ +
Plesiosaurs and pliosaurs were closely related marine lizards that
ranged in size from around 2-20m. They had sharp teeth and powerful
jaws, and preyed upon a variety of other marine animals depending on
their size, possibly including ammonites, fish, and other plesiosaurs.
The main difference between Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs is that
Plesiosaurs have longer necks and smaller heads. The Loch Ness Monster
is based on a Plesiosaur. +
Fossils +
- Finger bones x3, real – these were the finger bones in its flippers.
It is not clear whether these are from a Plesiosaur or a Pliosaur as
they are so similar +
- Pliosaur cervical vertebra – this is a vertebra from a Pliosaur's neck

*Ichthyosaur* +
_245-90 million years ago (Middle Triassic – Late Cretaceous)_ +
Icthyosaurs were 2-4m long dolphin-like marine reptiles which breathed
air and could swim at up to 25mph. However, since they are reptiles and
not mammals, they evolved this resemblance independently. This is called
convergent evolution. They were very abundant during the Jurassic until
replaced as top predator by plesiosaurs/pliosaurs. They fed on fish,
squid-like animals called belemnites, and shellfish. +
Fossils +
- Vertebra, cast +
- Skull cast, flattened, cast – this is a cast of a skull which was
flattened by the weight of the layers of sediment that buried it during
fossilisation. Features such as the eye socket and mouth are clearly
visible.

*Coprolite* +
This is a piece of fossilised poo. It is probably from a shark, but it
is hard to be sure, since all we have is the poo! Sometimes we can tell
things about animals’ diets from these, for example, if coprolite have
fish scales in them. +
Fossils +
- Coprolite, real
