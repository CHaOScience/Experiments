Useful information

Kit List: 

- Vacuum cleaner +
- Long tube +
- Small projectile, wrapped in bubble wrap.

Packing Away: 

Lives in a large red box labelled Vacuum Bazooka.

Explanation

Explanation: 

Not currently owned by CHaOS. It is Dave Ansell's.

Fire a small, light projectile up to 10m using a Vacuum cleaner and a
length of tubing.

The projectile is accelerated along the tubing by the pressure
difference generated by the Vacuum cleaner and shoots out of the end of
the tubing.

Explanation rating:

Risk Assessment: 

Fire a small, light projectile using a pressure difference generated by
a vacuum cleaner.

*Risks:* +
 +
1. People being hit, and potentially injured, by the projectile. +
 +
2. Damage to surroundings +
 +
3. Electrical Risk +
 +
4. Tripping over wires

*Control measures:* +
 +
1/2. a. Demonstrator should maintain control of the direction the
bazooka is firing in. +
 +
1/2. b. If not holding the firing tube the demonstrator should have the
projectile, end stop or both in his/her possession at all times to
prevent bazooka being fired by anyone else. +
 +
1/2. c. Bazooka should be sited to allow it to be fired along the room
into a wall or (ideally) +
 +
curtain, such that people who are not involved in the experiment cannot
accidentally walk through the area, and so that those that are
participating can be excluded from the firing area during firing. +
 +
1/2. d. Projectile should be composed principally of light-weight
packing material or similar (such as bubble wrap). It may be desirable
to weight the front end with blu-tak or similar to encourage predictable
flight but this should be done with consideration for the total
resulting weight. +
 +
3. Follow electrical parts RA +
 +
4. Tape wires to the floor, away from where people might trip over them.
If necessary, attach something brightly coloured so that cables are
clearly visible.

*In case of accident:* +
 +
1. In case of injury call first aider +
 +
2. Clear up any broken materials which might present a danger to
demonstrators/the public. Inform a committee member. +
 +
3. Follow electrical parts RA. In case of injury call first aider +
 +
4. In case of injury call first aider

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
