Introduction

See things appear and vanish through the two way mirror

Useful information

Kit List: 

- mirror table-top (make sure that the tops of the lights are covered) +
- mirror perspex sheet +
- pins to hold the two bits together +
- dark room +
(doesn't currently exist)

Explanation

Explanation: 

*** OVERVIEW ***

We have a sheet of perspex, with variable lights on each side that can
appear as a mirror or as a glass window, depending on the lighting.

Possible activities: +
- Demonstrating when you can see through the mirror and when you
can't. +
- Demonstrating how sometimes you can only see one way through the
mirror.

Other things to talk about: +
- Uses of two way mirrors and where we see them in real life - talk
about looking through windows at night with the lights on inside.

Tips for demonstrating: +
- Don't let children go under the table. Smaller children seem to be
tempted to do this, presumably to check what is really on the other
side. +
- When you talk, remember to speak up because your voice has to carry
through the sheet of perspex.

*** SETTING UP ***

When setting up ensure that that no light can get from one side to the
other without going through the perspex, so tape the plastic walls of
the inner dark room to the perspex.

Make sure that no external light gets into each side, i.e. that the
"curtains" in the entrance to each side of the perspex block out all the
light.

Ensure that the light from each lamp projects only away from the
perspex, not upwards or towards the perspex; in the past this has been
achieved by covering half the lamp with a cardboard cover wrapped in
black tap.

*** BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION ***

- Start off with everything dark - and try to get half a group in each
end.

- Try to get them to start lighting up one end at a time. Let them have
a play - some kids find it fascinating.

- When they a getting bored ask what is happening. Basically 10-20% of
the light is reflected and the rest goes through, so if the other side
is really dark all you can see is the reflection, and if the other side
is bright you will hardly see the reflection.

- The perspex lacks reciprocity: it appears as a mirror to one side but
as a window to the other, so you can be seen by the other side but you
cannot see them.

- A lot of children fail to realise this. The way to do this is to get
them to wave while asking things like "What can you see?" and "But what
can you see?", and directing your voice to one side or the other. Then
clarify by saying e.g. "So John can see you, but you can't see him".

*** OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ***

- Try to make the connection with seeing through windows at night vs day
(e.g. you have to shade the glass with your hand to see from the light
side to the dark side).

- Ask them if they've ever walked down a street at night and seen people
in their houses who have forgotten to draw the curtains. Ask if they
think the people could see them.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Two visitors sit on each side of a safety screen in the
dark. Use the dimmer lights to see each other.

|RISKS a|
1. Heavy screen, could fall

2. Hot lights, could burn

3. Electrical hazard

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Screen is made to be heavy enough to be sturdy. Ensure catches are
secure and that the screen won't fall over.

2. Experiment is designed so the lights are in a plastic enclosure so it
shouldn't get too hot. They are a long way away from the users so it is
difficult to touch them anyway.

3. All electrics are at 12V. Ensure that power supply has been PAT
tested within the last two years.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider, and
if it is a burn, run under cold water as soon as possible for 10 mins
|=======================================================================

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.

This experiment is sometimes run in a darkroom, see separate risk
assessment.
