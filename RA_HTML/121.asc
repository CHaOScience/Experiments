and messy: cornflour is one of our favourite experiments! Come and stick
your hands in, and figure out if it behaves like a liquid or a solid...

Useful information Kit List:  1. Washing up bowls 3-4 2. Cornflour 3kg
min 3. Water 4. Laminated cornflour picture Packing Away:  Drain as much
water off the cornflour mix as possible, and put dry-ish remains in to a
bin bag. DO NOT pour the cornflour mix down drains, as it may block
them. + Brush down the surface you were demonstrating on. Frequency of
use:  4 Explanation Explanation:  *In a nutshell* + You and the children
play with the gooey cornflour/water mix, exploring the concepts of
solids, liquids and substances that have properties of both. + Cornflour
is lots of irregular shaped particles that are separated by water
normally so are lubricated and can move. If you squash them together it
will push the water sideways a little bit and let them touch - now they
lock together and behave as a solid. + The picture shows cornflour under
a confocal microscope, which takes a 2-D slice through an image rather
than looking at the surface. *How to set up the experiment* + Slowly add
water to cornflour until it works - ask a committee member for help if
you're getting stuck. A ratio of 2.5 parts flour to 1 part water is
suggested, but the ratio may vary. *What you need to know about the
experiment* + (1) Cornflour is shear thickening. This means the higher
rate of shear, the higher the viscosity (i.e. the thicker it is). (Note:
Shear can be explained by considering 'layers' of cornflour particles
sliding past each other.) + (2) Try asking them whether it is a solid or
a liquid. You may want to get them to come up with definitions of the
terms solid and liquid - e.g. "what do we call hard things / things that
flow...?" Cornflour is like a solid and a liquid - Acts as a solid under
stress and a liquid otherwise + (3) It's like a room full of people and
when you try and make it move quickly, everyone tries to move at once
(while also moving closer together) and they all get in each other's way
and so no one can move anywhere. And when you do stuff to it slowly,
everyone has time to move out of the way and file out.

& Hopkinson reference here] [2]) *Want to know more?* + Shear thickening
is a problem in the oil industry, as when they are drilling they are
getting rock fragments in the mud coming back up, if there are too many
they behave similarly to the cornflour, with catastrophic results to
pumps. + Some people are talking about making

body armour] [3] using this effect, to make the body armour more
comfortable. + The opposite of shear thickening is shear thinning. Many
substances are shear thinning because the higher rate of shear can break
up interparticular interactions and reduce the viscosity - e.g. shampoo,
toothpaste - when you shear them by squeezing them out of the tube, it
flows, but when there's no shear, it sits quite happily on the
toothbrush without flowing anywhere. *Explanation warnings* + THICKENING
SOUPS IS DIFFERENT: the cornflour grains open up when heated and release
long starch molecules that tangle together forming a gel-like substance.
+ THIS IS NOT THIXOTROPY, which is concerned with time related effects.
Thixotropy is a long word and shouldn't be used with children. Adults
should be politely and gently explained the difference! The longer you
shear a thixotropic fluid the lower the viscosity (the thinner it
becomes) - e.g. paint - as you progressively break up interparticular
interactions. Many fluids that are shear thinning are also thixotropic.
Rheoplexy / Anti-thixotropy is the opposite - i.e. the longer you shear
a fluid the higher the viscosity (the thicker it becomes). Xanthan gum
might do this under certain conditions, but it's very rare for
substances to do this. Risk Assessment Date risk assesment last

|DESCRIPTION |Cornflour and water mix in a washing up bowl. |RISKS |1.
Powder may trigger asthma attack. + + 2. Minor slip hazard. + + 3.
Irritant to eyes. + + 4. After a while, the mixture accumulates some
dirt, which is not recommended for consumption. |ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO
MINIMISE RISKS |1. Clear up spilt powder. Where possible, do the
experiment outside. Do not allow children to help to mix in new powder
without first checking that they do not suffer from asthma. + + 2. Clear
up spills promptly; if the floor is smooth, ensure that a mop is +
available for this. + + 3. Avoid contact with eyes. + + 4. Encourage
children to wash hands after use. |ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN
ACCIDENT |1. Move child out of area and sit them down. Call first aider.
+ + 2. Call first aider in event of injury. + + 3. Rinse with eyewash
supplied if trained and confident to do so. Call first aider.
