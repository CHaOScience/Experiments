Talk from CBS 2017

Useful information

Kit List: 

The Kruskal's Count Experiment (lots of duplo or bigger bloacks) +
A monopoly board +
Grime Dice Experiment +
Evolution Games PLUS Experiment +
Large Fishtank(s) +
Food Colouring +
Wooden Spoons +
A bath toy with a spinny thing on it

Explanation

Explanation: 

What is maths? +
Volunteers for Kruskal's Count Experiment (3ish) +
Get them to go around marking where they visit +
Look for emergence of a steady state +
Talk about how we can get a steady state in similar games +
Monopoly +
Simulation of Monopoly + Volunteers (3ish) simulating as before +
Allows you to value how much a property is worth but only if you play
long enough. +
[ How long is long enough? +
Fish tanks + food colouring +
mixing times +
volunteer with spoon vs bath toy vs nothing +
can talk about how changing the rules affects these times +
simulate what it actually is for monop] +
[Grime dice experiment] +
Run through of evolution games +
simulation.

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Modelling evolution via game theory.

|RISKS |1. Children swallowing duplo or lego pieces +
 +
2. Tossed coins flying off and hitting someone +
 +
3. Many children trying to occupy the same card +
 +
4. Cards are slippy if stood on +
5. People may trip on dice +
6. Slip hazard from spilt liquids.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. The duplo pieces should be
sufficiently large to discourage swallowing. Do not use lego with very
small children and keep a close eye on the box of lego. +
 +
2. Check you can flip a coin without losing control of it, otherwise
just spin it on the table. It's perfectly fine to let the children toss
the coin themselves, but make sure they're capable of doing it safely
with a trial flip first. +
3. Keep the number of children playing the game on the giant cards under
a sensible limit, I would suggest 8 at a time, and discourage them from
running or any form of pushing and shoving +
4. Discourage people from actually stepping on the cards. +
5. Keep dice on table +
6. Do not use necessarily large amounts of water/food colouring. Replace
lids on nearby bottles when not in use. Mop up all spills promptly. Keep
visitors away from area until cleaned up.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN CASE OF ACCIDENT |1. Call first aider if child
swallows, if choking encourage child to cough. +
In all cases, call first aider in case of injury
