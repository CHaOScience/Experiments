Introduction

Public summary: 

You'll have seen some of these fruit flies before: these cool and
beautiful little creatures have shown us how genes can be inherited (by
following patterns of features like eye colours), and how genes work.

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

General public

This experiment aims to introduce kids to a wonderful model organism,
the Drosophila fruit fly.

Useful information

Kit List: 

Drosophila flies (wild-type, various mutants) in plastic vials with
foam/cotton wool bungs. Plastic petri dishes with Drosophila larvae.

Explanation

Explanation: 

\1) What are Drosophila? Often called 'fruit flies', they tend to be
found around over-ripe or rotting fruit. We're interested in them
because they've been the subject of lots of (mostly genetic) experiments
since they're easy to grow in the lab, have a short (~12 day) life cycle
and are easy to make mutants which can help us understand biological
processes. Have a look at them - see how big they are. Can you identify
males and females? (See below) What colour are their eyes (wild type
have red eyes).

\2) Drosophila development: Provided should be several Petri dishes
containing different developmental stages of the fruit fly. Explain to
the children the general concept of development (i.e. the process that
helps us go from a sperm/egg to a full grown adult) and how it differs
from species to species. Next, using the laminated descriptions/photos
of the developmental stages (see below), ask the children to put the
Petri dishes in the correct order of development. See lower down page
for some pictures/descriptions.

\3) Identification of Drosophila phenotypes: There will also be several
vials of flies with various phenotypes (some of which are listed
below…the exact phenotypes we will be given depends on availability
during the week of Crash, Bang, Squelch!). Discuss with the kids how
mutations in the DNA of the fly results in various fly abnormalities –
ask them to look at the flies and try to pick out some of the phenotypes
shown on the handout (shown below). You can use this to relate how
differences in DNA make humans look different (hair colour, eye colour
etc.) and say that we inherit these from our parents.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Drosophila fruit flies in plastic tubes +
eggs/larvae/pupae in petri dishes. Kids will look at the flies under a
light microscope, and at laminated pictures of fly development.

|RISKS a|
1.  Petri dishes/plastic tubes may be dropped/broken – risk of injury
from broken containers.
2.  Electrical equipment - hot and risk of electrocution if faulty or
wet.
3.  Petri dishes and plastic tubes may be opened - drosophila are
non-harmful insects, but it could cause panic/great excitement/silly
attempts to inflict the insects on siblings, which can be a safety risk
in a crowded place.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1.  Ensure that the flies are kept in close range. Ask children to be
careful when handling tubes/Petri dishes. Use plastic vials (instead of
glass) to contain flies if possible.
2.  Switch off microscope between uses if it starts to become hot.
Ensure experiment is not near a watery experiment or tap.
3.  Secure the Petri dish lids to the petri dishes using tape (stretchy
lab tape is fine) so that it is obvious to all that the dishes should
not be opened. Demonstrator to keep an eye on all plates.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1.  Wash any small cuts with soapy running water. Compress and elevate
large cuts. Call a first aider.
2.  Switch off electric equipment in event of an electrical accident,
call a first aider, clear area. In the event of a burn, hold area under
cold water for at least ten minutes. Call a first aider.
3.  Demonstrator must regain the petri dish/vial and diffuse the
situation. Call for help if necessary.

|=======================================================================

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
