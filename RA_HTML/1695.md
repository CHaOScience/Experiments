Molecular models and Periodic table
===================================

Introduction
Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

Useful information
Kit List: 

Periodic Table of elements
Molymod kits - general, graphite, diamond
Sample of Graphite (pencil lead), maybe some others

Frequency of use: 

1

Explanation
Explanation: 

Start of by discussing the periodic table, and how the valency of a compound can be determined from this.

Introduce Covalent, Ionic and metalic bonding. Using the diagrams provided in the kit. Also refer to the samples of each provided. i,e metals ductile as structure can rearrange and electron cloud can move with it. Whereas covalent bonding is directional so if broken snaps. Metals conduct electricity as deloacalised electrons in the sea of electrons. Ionic compounds form strongly bonded salts, can explain solvation and why they dissolve in solution.

Then introduce the diamond and graphite structures. Ask them what they know about diamond, most should know it is the hardest material on earth. Ask them from looking at the structures to say which they think it is and why. Explain that it clearly isn't the graphite as the layers easily slide over each other. Then introduce graphite as pencil lead, so say this is how it writes layers of graphite slide over each other some onto the paper. If people still follow talk explain that there is a free electron from each C between the layers. These are delocalised so can conduct electricity. Next take a piece of graphite and show that you can put charge through it.
