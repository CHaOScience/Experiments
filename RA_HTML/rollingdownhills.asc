Useful information

Kit List: 

Empty jam jar +
Jar half full of water +
Jar full of water +
Full jar of jam +
Gentle slope (paper covered plywood board will do, perhaps a couple more
jars to hold the back end up) +
(Not essential) A couple of things of different weights to drop that
won't break. A roll of sellotape and a board rubber worked well for
me. +
Foam block/thick pad/sleeping mat - something soft to place at the
bottom of the ramp to stop the jars escaping. The foam covering lungs
works.

Note that we don't have any dedicated kit for this one, but it's not
stuff that's hard to get for a particular event.

Packing Away: 

Most jam jars live in some physics box where there is space.

Explanation

Explanation: 

Race the jam jars down a slope to see which one is faster.

[[in-a-nutshell]]
In a Nutshell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Show people that rotational motion is a bit weird - you have to account
for the distribution of mass not just the overall properties.

[[setup]]
Setup
~~~~~

Not much to do. Place the ramp on the floor (if using a board then use a
couple of jars or find something else to hold the back end up). Place
the foam about 10cm past the end of the ramp (taping it down helps if
its small). It's a good idea to roll the jar of jam down the slope a few
times to get the jam to separate and the get the solid part to the edges
of the jar.

[[the-experiment]]
The Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I started off getting attention by telling people they'd be racing jars
down a hill. Once you've got someone's attention explain what's in the
jars (keep the one full of jam to one side for now). Before you get to
the jar racing, bring out the drop test objects and ask kids which one
is heavier (they can feel this for themselves) and ask which one will
hit the ground first if they're dropped from the same height at the same
time. Both should hit at the same time (demonstrate a couple of times,
from different heights if necessary). Could be worth mentioning to older
audiences that this is really weird - we have no idea why this should be
the case (due to equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass,
something that still doesn't have a satisfactory explanation). +
Now ask them to think about what will happen on the ramp - if gravity
doesn't care how 'heavy' things are, should the weight of the jars make
any difference? Will they all reach the bottom at the same time. Feel
free to prompt some more (why do you think X, what might cause Y) if the
group is old enough to engage. Let the kids pick up the jars and check
they have different weights. Get them to pick two to race and then do it
(if the kids are eager and you can get them to release when you say,
then they can hold the jars and let go when you tell them to). You can
try a couple of different pairs but a good one to end on is the empty vs
the full jar. +
From these races it looks like the heavier jar wins but this makes no
sense since we've already seen gravity doesn't care about weight. What
else could be going on here? Wait for a few responses then bring out the
jar with the jam in it. This jar is clearly heavier than the jar half
full of water and about the same weight as the jar full of water. Try
these two races and you find a weird result - the jam jar is slower than
even the half-full water jar even though it weighs more. +
Get the kids talking about it a bit and then ask them if they've been on
a roundabout/merry-go-round/turntable thing at a park. Is it easier to
stand up/hold on in the middle or near the edge? What about pushing the
thing if someone else is on it - is it easier to make it spin fast if
the other person is in the middle or at the edge? (You can also try to
connect this to Spinny Chair experiment happening outsite at CBS.)
Exactly the same thing is happening here with the jars. The empty jar
has almost all of its mass concentrated in a very thin layer of glass a
long way from the axis of rotation whereas the one full of water has a
lot of mass quite close to the middle. It's therefore much 'easier' to
make the full jar spin than the empty jar (could be worth mentioning, to
reinforce the idea that weight is irrelevant, that if there were no
friction the jars would all slide (not roll!) down the hill in the same
amount of time). The interesting case of the half-full jar and the jam
jar can be explained similarly - the half-full jar still has a
reasonable amount of water near the middle but in the jam jar, all the
heavy parts (the solid bits) of the jam have been squished to the edges
and are now stuck there (it's viscous so the jam should take quite a
while to flow back into the middle and remix). The result: a layer of
heavy stuff near the edge (very similar to the empty jar!). +
In conclusion for linear motion the distribution of mass is irrelevant,
only the total, whereas for rotational motion it's not just the mass
that matters, it's position is important as well.

[[advanced-explanation]]
Advanced Explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the older kids/interested parents you can explain a bit about
moments of inertia: rotational analogue of mass that is determined by
adding up (each little bit of mass * it's distance from the axis of
rotation); can be very different if you choose the axis in a different
direction; implication is we can change momenents of inertia by changing
mass distribution -> figure skating (could also bring in angular
momentum here... "if a skater brings her arms in she's reduced her MOI
but to keep the 'amount of spin' (angular momentum) the same she has
spins faster"). Can demo this in the playground - several people stand
at the edge of a roundabout spinning fairly slowly and walk in to the
middle. The roundabout should speed up and if they walk back out it
should get slower again. They can try this out at Spinny Chair if it's
set up. +
The wikipedia page on 'moment of inertia' has more information and a
nice gif animation of (front to back) a solid cylinder, cylindrical
shell, ball and spherical shell racing down a slope.

Risk Assessment: 

DESCRIPTION +
Rolling cake tins, and jam jars down slopes with different weight
distributions. Describing what is happening with a bar with weights at
each end.

RISKS +
1. The objects rolling into people, and tripping them up +
2. The objects bouncing off things and breaking, then possibly making
sharp objects as a result +
3. The long bar hitting people. +
4. Slip hazard from spilled water if jars break. Also sharp glass if
broken. +
5. Jars falling off the bench and hitting people.

CONTROL MEASURES +
1. Make sure the base of the slope is not heading towards a gangway. +
2. Put something soft at the base and around the sides of the slope to
catch the objects. Consider wrapping the jars in sellotape. +
3. Keep the bar under control. +
The weights are covered with foam +
4. See 2. Keep children away from any breakages and dispose of safely. +
5. Do the experiment on the ground.

IN EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY +
In case of injury call a first aider. +
In case of breakage, close experiment until broken glass and spilled
water is cleared up.
