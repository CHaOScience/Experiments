Introduction

Make fascinating bubbles which rather than floating on water actually
sink.

[[what-to-do]]
What to Do
~~~~~~~~~~

Add 3-4 tsp of salt into the wash bottle, or rather more into a washing
up liquid bottle and then top it up with water.

Add some washing up liquid into the tank of water - probably 2-3 times
stronger than normal washing up water.

Clear any bubbles from the top of the tank.

Drip water onto the top of the tank from 5-10cm above and look at the
bubbles being formed on the surface. Are they all the same?

Now do the same thing looking into the side of the tank, for a couple of
hundred drops, does anything interesting appear?

[[what-may-happen]]
What may Happen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the top mostly you will produce normal drops, but sometimes you will
see what look like bubbles but if you look closer they reflect light
much better and they have far more momentum skittering across the
surface. +
If you look from the side you sometimes see bubbles which actually sink
rather than float.

[[what-is-going-on]]
What is going on?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are creating what are known as antibubbles. A conventional bubble is
air surrounded by a thin film of water in air, an antibubble is the
other way around, water surrounded by a thin film of air in water. +
Both types of bubble are highly unstable in pure water because water
molecules attract one another very strongly and try to minimise the
surface area of the liquid. Detergent molecules have one end which is
very attracted to water and a long oily tail which is repelled by it. so
they cover the surface of the bubble stabilising it.

The air in an antibubble will cause it to float gently so they would be
hard to tell from conventional bubbles. The salt weighs them down so
they sink and you can tell the difference.

The antibubbles seem to form best when they are dropped onto water that
is falling so the impact is less violent.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Creating antibubbles using saltwater and washing up liquid

|RISKS a|
1. Bubble mixture getting into eyes

2. Ingestion of bubble mixture/allergies

3. Slip hazard

4. Electric risk if water spills onto any nearby electric
cables/equipment

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Try to keep children under control. Demonstrator should show effect
unless group are very calm and should take bottle away if child shows
signs of getting excitable.

2. Do not allow very young children to hold the bottle.

3. Clear up any spillage immediately.

4. Ensure there are no electric components on ground near the
experiment.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1.Call first aider in case of injury. If the salt mixture from the
dropping bottle, or washing up water from tank, gets into an eye,
demonstrator must call a first aider and may perform an eye wash if
trained and confident to do so.

2.Call first aider in case of injury. If ingestion occurs, get victim to
drink a glass of water. If liquid gets on skin, check about allergies.

3.Call first aider in case of injury.

4.Call first aider in case of injury.
