                    <p>Set up the challenge</p>
<p>Partially fill the tube with water<br />
Float the partially inflated balloon in the tube with the pipe cleaner hook pointing upwards</p>
<p>What you could say:<br />
We're going to think about intelligence here. To start off with, can anyone tell me what intelligence is? 'how clever someone is' Ok, great and how do we normally find out how intelligent someone is? 'IQ test, asking really difficult questions' Right, so this is how intelligence tests normally work for humans   [insert some information about IQ tests and other intelligence tests for humans (see below)]  but what about if you wanted to test the intelligence of an animal? 'you could get all sorts of crazy answers here, write them down!' We can set practical tests to find out how well animals understand the world works, quite often these look a bit like the challenge I have here: </p>
<p>Your challenge is to get the balloon out of the tube using the objects here [give them the gravel, straws, pegs etc and let them play around/experiment with trying to get the balloon out, the easiest way to do this is the raise the water lever by carefully dropping gravel in to raise the water level].</p>
<p>Whether successful or not congratulate for valiant effort, then ask: So you managed (or didn't manage...) to get the balloon out, do you think that any other animals would be able to do so too? Which ones? - primates and birds match us most closely for intelligence, by using stones to make the water level and the balloon rise it shows that they understand that water is displaced when things are dropped into it. Do you think that a bird would want to try and get this balloon out of this particular tube? 'no, not really' You're right, it probably wouldn't really be interested in getting this tiny little balloon, so we need to design experiments that are relevant to that animal, what do you think a bird might be more interested than the balloon?'  - food! [same experiment with a floating grape]</p>
<p>If demonstrating with Animal skulls, the magpie and pigeon are good to use here. The cranial cavity is a good indicator of brain size. Brains use lots of the body’s resources, so animals will only have big brains if they need them. Intelligence can be linked to brain size, but we have to also look at the size of the animal. Bigger animals have bigger brains because they have to deal with more (unconscious) processes in the body. So we have to compare animals of a similar size: in this case magpie and pigeon. Magpie has the bigger brain, which suggests it is more intelligent, which is correct.<br />
(For older audiences: We use the Encephalisation Quotient. This compares a species’ actual brain size to its expected brain size, given its body size, to give a rough estimate of intelligence. It’s not entirely reliable however, and generally works better for mammals than other animals.)</p>
<p>More information for older audiences/background for demonstrators:</p>
<p>The experiment we did is a way of measuring specifically ‘Physical Intelligence’. This is how well an animal can understand physical objects, such as information about an object’s properties (size, shape, weight); and objects’ relationship with each other/the environment, such as whether or not an object of a particular size will fit in a particular space. It also goes on to include insightful use of tools and objects when solving problems. Problem solving via conditioning and blind trial-and-error are not considered to be indicators of intelligence.<br />
Tool use (an external object used as an extension of an animal’s body to attain a goal) and especially tool manufacture are used as indicators of higher levels of physical intelligence. </p>
<p>Human intelligence:</p>
<p>Intelligence is more than just how 'clever' you are - it measures various aspects of cognitive ability (and the actual definition can depend on which psychologist you ask!).<br />
There are many different types of intelligence, such as Gf (fluid intelligence; reasoning and solving novel problems), Gc (crystallised intelligence; ability to use skills, knowledge and experience), Gv (visual processing), Gs (processing speed) and many more. There is a general factor ‘g’ that is thought to underlie all of these.<br />
Different IQ tests test different types (or combination of types) of intelligence. Currently, the most commonly used intelligence test is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) which measure several types of intelligence. Other tests include the Stanford-Binet and Ravens’ Matrices. The scales are ranked ordinally, with 100 being the average score, 1 SD is 15 points, 2 SDs are 30 points etc.</p>
<p>Animal cognition:</p>
<p>Why is assessing animal cognition difficult?<br />
1.	Animals can show complex patterns of behaviour that don’t actually involve cognition. An example is fixed action patterns that can be seen in digger wasps. When bringing food back to the nest, the wasp will place the cricket in a specific position outside the nest, go in to inspect the nest, then come back out and retrieve the cricket to bring into the nest. If the cricket is moved during the inspection stage even just a tiny amount, when the wasp comes to retrieve it, it must repeat the behaviour from the start (ie. place cricket, inspect nest, retrieve cricket)<br />
2.	Behaviours can seem human-like even when they are not, such as in the case of Clever Hans, a horse that appeared to be able to count and perform arithmetic, when in fact it was using subtle body language cues from the trainer (who was unaware of making them) to determine the correct answer</p>
<p>How is it assessed then?<br />
1.	Comparative psychology: artificial tasks in the lab, using a few representative species<br />
2.	Ethology: Observing natural (or semi-naturalistic) behaviours in animals, in a wide variety of species<br />
Good studies use both approaches.</p>
