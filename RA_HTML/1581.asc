Explanation

Explanation: 

When you have a large number of children to entertain for an unknown
period of time, who do you call? Phase busters!

**This game is designed to be run in schools or on jamborees when there
are a large number of children who need entertaining**

The principles of the game are simple. You yell a phase, or a phase
transition, and the children act in a manner akin to molecules in that
phase.

*Basic calls* : +
Solid: The children stand still, with their hands by their sides. Some
huddling may be encouraged, but isn't necessary. +
Liquid: The children walk slowly, I generally also bring my hands up,
palms together, wiggling in front of me to worm around. They should
probably come close together too. +
Gas: Walking (or running if they seem trustworthy) as far apart as
possible, bouncing off the edges of the container. +
Melt: Transition solid to liquid +
Evaporate: Transition liquid to gas +
Condense: Transition gas to liquid +
Freeze: Transition liquid to solid +
Sublimate: Transition solid to gas +
Deposit: Transition gas to solid

*Other call options:* +
Oxygen or Nitrogen: Children are a gas in pairs (holding hands with a
partner) +
Ozone: Children are a gas in 3s (have some demonstrators there to make
up to a multiple of 3 if necessary) +
Neon: Children are a monatomic gas, as per the previous gas
description +
Benzene: Children are in rings of 6 +
etc. (make up as you like)

*Spiel:* +
To start with I introduce that we're stood in a beaker (or something
similar) and that the children are the molecules. Maybe some discussion
here of what molecules/atoms are; don't need to go too complicated. See
if they know what the molecules do in a solid, liquid and gas. Then
start making some calls and get them to do the appropriate actions. This
is a good time to gauge how well the group is behaving and point out
that those misbehaving/pushing/running everywhere may have to go stand
with a teacher. Use solid to stop them for more instructions. +
More Q&A. How do we get between phases (or states, or types, whatever
they can handle)? If you hold ice in your hand what happens? What's that
called? Try a few out, remember you can still call solid to get them all
to stop. I'd only stick with what they're likely to have heard of at
this stage. +
Trickier now, sublimate and deposit are added. See if anyone knows the
word, maybe get them all to say it back. Examples include dry ice (solid
carbon dioxide), pieces of ice in cold dry conditions, formation of snow
and frost.

*Variant*: +
Knock out game (maybe once they're getting tired, or from the start
because you're bored of running the other one. Don't make it knock out
for a bit so that they get the hang of it and all get a chance to do
something. Use the alternative calls, sometimes people won't have a full
group. These people (or the last group formed) are out. They can cheer
on their compatriots as they play on or be gradually siphoned off to
home time etc. For example: +
14 children in room, call "Benzene", two rings of 6 form, other children
out. +
12 children in room, call "Ozone", last ozone to form is out. +
9 children in room, call "Nitrogen", lonely child out. +
8 children in room, "Benzene" again, 2 spare children out. +
6 children in room, "Ozone" again, last ozone formed is out. +
3 children in room, call "Neon", they all look confused as no one is
out. +
3 children in room, call "Nitrogen", lonely kid is out, other 2 children
are winners.

|=======================================================================
|EXPERIMENT |Explore the phases of matter in an exciting game

|RISKS a|
1. Falling over

2. Running into each other/static objects

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Children should be asked be careful and to be aware of falling over
risk. The speed of the game should be limited to a safe one (get them to
walk instead of run if they are behaving dangerously). Over excited
children should be asked to stand out for a round or two, there should
be teachers on hand who can deal with that sort of thing. Make sure that
the floor isn't slippery before starting (wet hall floor, leaves
outside, wet grass etc.).

2. Clear away or keep the game away from any static objects likely to
cause danger. Use area markers which are not dangerous to run into. As
for falling over risk, limit the excitement of the game as required and
make the children aware of the risk ("Be careful not to run into each
other, ok?").

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1. Call first aider in event of injury. Stop experiment if required.

2. Call first aider in event of injury. Stop experiment if required.
