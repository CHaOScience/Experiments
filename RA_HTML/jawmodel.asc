Introduction

Public summary: 

An enlarged model of the jaw with some giant teeth that can be opened
up. Find out why we have milk teeth, why there are different types of
teeth and why different species have different teeth.

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

General public

Anatomical model of the half jaw, parts can be removed to show structure
of the teeth.

Explanation

Explanation: 

ACTIVITIES: +
-show whole model- what do they think it is? Let them point to their own
jaws +
-take the model apart; any ideas what individual bits are?

OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT: +
-losing teeth; getting new ones (especially when the kids are at that
age) +
- teeth are different- why do you need different shaped teeth? If we've
got the animal skulls out, you could get them to go and have a look at
those afterwards and think about why different animals have
differently-shaped teeth. +
- toothache- look at nerves coming into teeth- that's how you can feel
pain

TIPS FOR DEMONSTRATING: +
-focus your explanation on the age of the audience; if you have 6/7 year
olds that are just getting their adult teeth, talk about that; if you
have teenagers, you could talk about braces etc.

BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION:

- Compare model to skull so they know what they're looking at. How the
jaw bone fits onto the skull so we can open and close it to speek, eat
etc. Feel the joint on themselves putting their fingers on the sides of
their head just in front of ear, moving their jaw around. Explain how it
can slide forward so we can open our mouths further.

- Different types of teeth have different functions. Flat ones at the
front for cutting things, pointy ones for tearing/ripping, flat big ones
at the back for grinding. When do we get new teeth? baby ones, adult
ones, wisdom teeth. Look how deep the teeth go into our gums, can see on
skull xray too.

- See where the blood vessels and nerves go to teeth. Think about what
nerves are doing, funny that they go to bones. When do we know about
them being there...toothache. Why might we get it? Protection covering
teeth damaged, sugar, bacteria and stuff.

OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT:

- medical procedures on teeth: fillings, braces, dentures; the idea is
to get them thinking about what could go wrong and how they would fix it
if they were a dentist
