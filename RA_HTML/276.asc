Explanation

Explanation: 

*** OVERVIEW/THINGS YOU MIGHT LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ***

- The life cycles of frogs, bees, cockroaches, and butterflies. +
- Social structure of bee colonies and communication amongst bees +
- Using stages of insect development to "date" a decomposing corpse +
- Insect growth using the cockroaches

*** BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION ***

\1) Ask the child to choose a set of vials that they find interesting.

\2) Once they have chosen a vial, ask them if they know what is inside
the set of vials? (frog, butterfly, cockroaches or bees)

\3) Next, say that this set of vials shows the life cycle of the
butterfly/bee/frog. During this life cycle, the animal changes from an
egg to an adult animal (which produces or fertilizes eggs which will go
through the life cycle again).

\4) You can then ask the child to try to put the vials in the proper
order (egg -> adult) without looking at the numbers of the top of the
vial. Once they have done this, you should go through exactly what is in
each vial.

\5) Start by describing the egg. This is one cell (a tiny ball of
nutrient and information (DNA)) which divides lots and lots of times to
produce larvae.

\6) Next discuss the larvae. Emphasize how the larvae spends all its
time eating and eating and eating! This is so it can grow really fast
and store energy for metamorphosis!

\7) Finally, explain the pupae stage - at this point the larvae
undergoes metamorphosis and becomes an adult! What is metamorphosis? It
refers to something changing from one form to another completely new
form. Isn't it amazing that the larval form can change into the adult
form in just about two weeks?!

\8) After you've finished explaining the life cycle of the animal, you
might ask the child if humans go through metamorphosis. Explain that
while humans don't go through metamorphosis, we do change a lot in our
mummy's tummy! We also go from an egg (one tiny cell smaller than the
full stop at the end of this sentence) which divides lots of times to
create a baby!

*** TIPS FOR DEMONSTRATING ***

\1) Always count the total number of insects you have on display before
you start demonstrating…make sure that none of these disappear during
the day (they roll away very easily)!

\2) Get out one set of vials at time to avoid overwhelming/distracting
the children

*** OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ***

**BEES** +
1) Social Structure of Bees (http://www.indianchild.com/honey_bee.htm
[1]) +
- Each bee colony has a very organized social structure. +
- Bees tell each other where food is through different dances. +
- Males/drones: +
- Develop from unfertilized eggs (parthenogenesis) +
- Worker bees; +
- Develops from fertilized eggs +
- Female bee: Queen +
- Develops from fertilized eggs +
- Produces pheromones which controls the behavior of her workers +
- Fed lots food!

\2) Communication Among Bees (http://www.indianchild.com/honey_bee.htm
[1]) +
- Bees communicate by pheromones (chemicals produced by the queen that
the other bees "smell") and dances. +
- This communication is very important to maintain the
organization/social structure within the colony so that all of the bees
can survive (the queen, workers, and drones cannot live alone - they
depend on each member of the colony).

**FROGS** +
1) Egg -> Frogspawn -> Tadpoles -> Frogs

\2) Frogspawn is like jelly, provides a food source for the growing
embryo (the black spot)

\3) Tadpoles - sometimes eat each other (cannibalism)

) Tree frogs; where do they lay their eggs? - in the water collected at
the bases of leaves. Are often brightly coloured and very poisonous
(used to make poison arrows. The Golden Tree Frog is toxic enough to
kill 20 people or two elephants, chickens and dogs have died from
touching paper that has been touched by a frog!

**BUTTERFLIES** +
1) Patterns/colouration - eye spots deflect attack from the butterfly's
body , camouflage is another way of increasing the likelihood of
survival allowing it to rest undetected

\3) Forensic Entomology: (http://www.forensicentomology.com/appear.htm
[2]) +
- Forensic Entomology examines the stages of develop of insects in a
decaying corpse to determine when the body died! +
- For example, many insects will lay eggs on a corpse. These eggs will
hatch and become larvae, which feed on the decaying corpse. By examining
the size/weight of the larvae, these scientists can determine how old
the corpse is!

*** SCIENCE BACKGROUND FOR DEMONSTRATORS ***

More information on Forensic Entomology
(http://www.forensicentomology.com/appear.htm [2]) +
"What information can a forensic entomologist provide at the death
scene?"

Forensic entomologists are most commonly called upon to determine the
postmortem interval or "time since death" in homicide investigations.
The forensic entomologist can use a number of different techniques
including species succession, larval weight, larval length, and a more
technical method known as the accumulated degree hour technique which
can be very precise if the necessary data is available. A qualified
forensic entomologist can also make inferences as to possible postmortem
movement of a corpse. Some flies prefer specific habitats such as a
distinct preference for laying their eggs in an outdoor or indoor
environment. Flies can also exhibit preferences for carcasses in shade
or sunlit conditions of the outdoor environment. Therefore, a corpse
that is recovered indoors with the eggs or larvae of flies that
typically inhabit sunny outdoor locations would indicate that someone
returned to the scene of the crime to move and attempt to conceal the
body.

Similarly, freezing or wrapping of the body may be indicated by an
altered species succession of insects on the body. Anything that may
have prevented the insects from laying eggs in their normal time frame
will alter both the sequence of species and their typical colonization
time. This alteration of the normal insect succession and fauna should
be noticeable to the forensic entomologists if they are familiar with
what would normally be recovered from a body in a particular
environmental habitat or geographical location. The complete absence of
insects would suggest clues as to the sequence of postmortem events as
the body was probably either frozen, sealed in a tightly closed
container, or buried very deeply.

Entomological evidence can also help determine the circumstances of
abuse and rape. Victims that are incapacitated (bound, drugged, or
otherwise helpless) often have associated fecal and urine soaked clothes
or bed dressings. Such material will attract certain species of flies
that otherwise would not be recovered. Their presence can yield many
clues to both antemortem and postmortem circumstances of the crime.
Currently, it is now possible to use DNA technology not only to help
determine insect species, but to recover and identify the blood meals
taken by blood feeding insects. The DNA of human blood can be recovered
from the digestive tract of an insect that has fed on an individual. The
presence of their DNA within the insect can place suspects at a known
location within a definable period of time and recovery of the victims'
blood can also create a link between perpetrator and suspect.

The insects recovered from decomposing human remains can be a valuable
tool for toxicological analysis. The voracious appetite of the insects
on corpses can quickly strip the remains down to the bones. In a short
period of time the fluids (blood and urine) and soft tissues needed for
toxicological analysis disappear. However, it is possible to recover the
insect larvae and run standard toxicological analyses on them as you
would human tissue. Toxicological analysis can be successful on insect
larvae because their tissues assimilate drugs and toxins that
accumulated in human tissue prior to death."

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Looking at dead insects in small sealed tubes & talking
about them

|RISKS |Smashing a specimen tube and magnifying glass can cause cuts,
and the preservative to come out. Preservative is 1% Propylene
phenoxetol, which should not be irritant to eyes or skin at that
concentration, but which may be harmful if ingested. Propylene
phenoxetol is a preservative used in personal care product and is safe.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Keep a careful eye on the tubes and magnifying glass. If necessary,
reduce the number of tubes on display.

Make sure all are tightly closed with sellotape on top of the seal to
make it obvious that the tube should not be opened.

Demonstrator must know the location of the nearest eyewash.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
Call first aider in case of injury.

Wash skin with that has come into contact with preservative with water.

If preservative gets into eyes call a first aider. Use eyewash to wash
out of eyes if trained and confident to do so.

Unless large quantities ingested, recommend that parents take child to
GP if child becomes ill, and state that 1% propylene phenoxytol was the
substance ingested.
