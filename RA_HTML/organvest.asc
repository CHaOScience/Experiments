Explanation

Explanation: 

This game can be tailored to the particular child, and depending on how
old they are you can just either ask them to put the organs in the right
place, or talk about each one in a little more detail.

I usually do the organs in the following order (getting more difficult
as the game progresses) and talk about/ask the child what each one is
for:

HEART

Ask them to look at the colour and guess what goes inside it. +
Tell them that it acts as a pump, and is needed to push blood around the
body.

Keen: could go into why blood is needed etc.) +
Ultra keen, try and grab a spare stethoscope and find their their heart
beat at the appropriate place.

LUNGS:

Talk about breathing; try and get them to link up lungs to the mouth
with the trachea (NB trachea does not currently exist as a component of
the vest, but you can talk about it anyway!). Interesting fact: If the
inner surface of the lungs could be stretched out flat, they would
occupy an area of around 80 to 100 square meters – about the size of
half of a tennis court!

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM: +
Try and get them to link it all up, and explain what it does in terms of
breaking your food down into smaller bits so it can be used to re-build
things inside your body. Also talk about what happens in the end, and
try and get them to guess what it comes out as (usually good for getting
a giggle, but be warned sometimes the kids come up with very rude words
much to the embarrassment of everyone around...)

KIDNEYS/ BLADDER +
Get them to link them up and talk about what happens when you drink too
much water etc. Get them to try and guess what's in the bladder by its
colour (also often gets another giggle).

LIVER: +
Difficult one to explain. I usually go along the lines of its like a big
factory in your body where things are broken down and important things
like stuff in your blood is made. +
Ultra Keen: talk about it also being needed to break things like poisons
and alcohol, and try and mention what might happen to the liver for
instance in alcohol poisoning.

INTERESTING FACTS / TIPS:

Small intestine is 7m long, but is coiled up to fit inside the body. +
Furthermore, due to villi total surface area is 2000 square meters =
half a football pitch.

By the time you turn 70, your heart will have beated two-and-a-half
billion times (figuring on an average of 70 beats per minute.) = 175
million litres of blood = 50 olympic swimming pools!
