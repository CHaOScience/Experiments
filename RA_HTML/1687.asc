Explanation

Explanation: 

Looking at other planets, animal under extreme conditions and
extrapolating this to some first guesses about what life on other
planets might be like.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Apart from lots of pictures of planets, and maybe the
inclusion of the orrery (separate RA) my expectation of the experiment
will be that it contains some skulls and other paraphernalia of animals
who live under extreme conditions, hence I've just copied in the RA of
animal skulls below

|RISKS a|
Some skulls may have sharp teeth or beaks.

If dropped, skulls may fall on feet or shatter, causing cuts and other
injuries.

Possible infection risk from bone if skin is cut by touching the bone

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Remind children to handle skulls carefully; in particular, be careful
not to pinch fingers/hands in the jaw.

Again, remind children to be careful, and demonstrator only have a few
skulls present at a time to minimise risk of children picking up or
playing with skulls. Demonstrator to keep an eye on anybody holding
skulls. If a skull smashes, clear it up immediately with dustpan and
brush. Any skulls with sharp edges may need to be smoothed off or
replaced.

We have boiled the skulls we found in bleach for a few hours to
sterilise them. Please note, however, this does not necessarilly mean
that the skulls are sterile now.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
In case of injury call first aider.

Warn parents of the possibility of infection if a child does cut
him/herself on the skull; Advise parents to take child to a doctor if
the cut looks infected.
