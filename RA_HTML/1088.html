                    <p>Interim explanation copied from <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~nkids/Neurokids_Program/Lessons_files/NeuroKids-Prism%20Goggles%20Lesson.pdf" title="http://www.umich.edu/~nkids/Neurokids_Program/Lessons_files/NeuroKids-Prism%20Goggles%20Lesson.pdf">http://www.umich.edu/~nkids/Neurokids_Program/Lessons_files/NeuroKids-Pr...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>
<p>INTRO/BACKGROUND: The following is an example of what the leader might say<br />
during the introduction, including some specific questions to keep the kids engaged. It<br />
does not need to be repeated verbatim, and probably will contain more information that is<br />
necessary to explain.<br />
Can anyone describe what learning is? Scientists like to say that “Learning is the way we<br />
acquire information about the world”, but this can mean a lot of things, information can<br />
mean things like phone numbers, friends names, times-tables, but it can also be things<br />
like friends faces, how to make a free throw, or how to draw a picture. When scientists<br />
over the last century have thought about learning, they realized something very<br />
important, and that is that some kinds of learning are require conscious activity and<br />
others happen unconsciously, and they refer to these kids of learning as explicit and<br />
implicit learning.<br />
Consciousness can be tricky to talk about, maybe you think you know exactly what we<br />
mean by conscious and unconscious activity, but lets look at it a different way. If we<br />
asked you to describe how you learned that 6*8 is 48, you could probably describe how<br />
math works, that if you took a bunch of M &amp; M’s and made a square with 6 rows of 8<br />
M&amp;M’s each that you could count each one and make 48. Some things that we learn are<br />
easy to talk about, but others are more difficult, take free throws for example, somebody<br />
probably showed you how to hold the ball, but how exactly do you know how to make<br />
the shot?<br />
Scientists look at it this way, times tables and correct free throws are both kinds of<br />
information that can be learned. The type of information that you can easily think about<br />
and describe is termed explicit {think explained-explicit}, and the kinds that you kind of<br />
just do are termed implicit {less easy to remember, think implied}. Now in everyday life<br />
not everything fits nicely into one category or the other, but for today we’re going to stick<br />
with that definition.</p>
<p>When you learn something new individual cells in your brain change. One thing that<br />
scientists are currently studying is where in your brain specific cells are changing.<br />
Were going to show you a little game that will change a few cells in a part of your brain<br />
called the cerebellum. One thing that your cerebellum helps you do is compare what you<br />
see with what your body is doing. You have lots of sensors in your muscles that keep<br />
track of where your body is. If you move your arm, you know where it’s moving even if<br />
you cannot see it, or aren’t paying attention. A copy of this, along with a lot of other<br />
information goes to your cerebellum.<br />
Your cerebellum helps you by comparing what you want to do with what you actually<br />
did. So if you’re playing a beanbag toss game, and you throw a beanbag at a target then<br />
you either hit the target or miss the target. Part of your cerebellum is working like a little<br />
computer, and each time you throw a bag, it keeps track of how close you were to the<br />
target. It takes the information about how much you missed the target by and uses it to<br />
change the way your arm moves the next time you throw.<br />
When you play the beanbag toss game, were going to move where the target appears to<br />
be, so you will end up throwing it further away from the target than you would expect,<br />
but if you take enough throws your cerebellum will do the work for you and change the<br />
way your arm moves without you even having to think about it. And your throws will get<br />
closer and closer.</p>
<p>ACTIVITY: Volunteers will lead groups of 4-6 students. Students will be trying to throw<br />
a beanbag into a target. Each student will first get an opportunity to practice a few throws<br />
and then they will be given a pair of Prism Goggles. Prism Goggles distort the field of<br />
vision to about 20 degrees in one direction and make it very difficult to hit the target and<br />
beanbags will probably be thrown all over the place. Other students that aren’t<br />
participating can help collect stray beanbags. While wearing the goggles, each student<br />
should get 20-30 attempts to hit the target. Students should be encouraged at this time to<br />
“let their brains adapt to the situation” rather than manually adjusting where they aim<br />
(many students will attempt to adjust their aim). After they begin to consistently hit the<br />
target, ask the student to remove the goggles and throw again. Many of the students will<br />
accidentally miss in the opposite direction. Some students may not show these effects of<br />
compensation. Allow each student to have his turn to wear the glasses and try the<br />
experiment.</p>
<p>DISCUSSION: Once we put on prism goggles, there are two ways to adjust and hit the<br />
target. One strategy is explicit, we tell ourselves that our aim is off and try to throw the<br />
beanbag where we think the target is, rather than where it appears. This type of strategy<br />
quickly adjusts our performance, but requires us to guess where the beanbag should be<br />
thrown. For students that use this strategy, when the goggles are removed, and they are<br />
asked to throw again, they will not experience an opposite shift in their aim. When using<br />
the implicit learning strategy we throw the beanbag where the target appears to be. This<br />
strategy requires several attempts, each time we throw a beanbag, our brain makes a tiny<br />
adjustment, in a brain circuit that we do not have conscious control over. The adjustments<br />
last for a while which is why after removing the prism goggles, our aim has been adjusted<br />
in the opposite direction, and takes a few more trials to re-learn.</p>
<p>Some questions to ask {feel free to add your own}:<br />
Is one kind of learning better than the other? {each have their own benefits, think about<br />
the attention demands of explicit learning}<br />
What is an example of an activity that is more effectively learned implicitly/explicitly?<br />
{maybe something like soccer/friends names}<br />
Why would we want to learn things without having to pay attention to them?<br />
Are there any subjects in school that are best learned implicitly? {foreign language}</p>

                    <p>RISKS:<br />
1. Child becomes disorientated wearing goggles or on removing them and is more likely to fall over.<br />
2. Small objects being thrown towards target escape and present a trip hazard<br />
3. Small objects to be thrown towards target hit other people.</p>
<p>MITIGATION:<br />
1. Ask child to stand still on one spot if they are wearing the goggles. If they feel dizzy, remove the goggles and tell them to sit down on the floor. Do not allow them to run around wearing the goggles. Remember that they may be equally disorientated on removing the goggles - do not allow them to run off immediately and again make them sit down if they are dizzy.<br />
2. Keep an eye on the whereabouts of the objects, do not get too many out at once. Where possible, use objects such as beanbags which will not bounce and roll all over the floor.<br />
3. Do not allow children to collect objects while the subject is still throwing them. Position the experiment so that other people are not in the firing line. Use soft, light objects where possible.</p>
<p>ACTION IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT:<br />
1, 2 and 3. Call first aider if necessary.</p>
