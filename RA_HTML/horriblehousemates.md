Explanation
Explanation: 

\*\*\* OVERVIEW \*\*\*

Children will look at lots of jars of pests that we share our houses with, try to identify them, and learn a few things are each pest.

Other things to talk about:
1) What makes the animal a pest?
2) Where does the pest live in a house? How is the pest adapted to the environment in the house?
3) What is the life cycle of the pest?
4) What is the actual problem with having this pest in the house (perceived vs. actual)?
5) Taxonomy

Tips for demonstrating:
1) Always count the total number of insects you have on display before you start demonstrating…make sure that none of these disappear during the day (they roll away very easily)!
2) Ask them to look at their fingernail or a hair under the magnifying glass – this will give them a better concept of scale and show them how much more detail you can see under the magnifying glass!

\*\*\* BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION \*\*\*

1) Ask the child to choose a sample on display that looks interesting to them. Then go through the following questions with them:
2) What do you think this is?
3) Where do you think it might live in your house? Why would it like to live there?
4) Do you want this living in your house? Why (not)?
5) Allow them to look at the sample under the magnifying glass.

See explanations for each insect/pest below

\*\*\* OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT \*\*\*

Discuss the life cycle of each pest
o Egg
o Larvae (goal = eat and grow!)
o Pupae (undergoes metamorphosis)
o Adult
Discuss Taxonomy

\*\*\* SCIENCE BACKGROUND FOR DEMONSTRATORS \*\*\*

o Ladybugs eat aphids, and therefore are often used to protect your houseplants or garden!
o Signs of an aphid infestation include honeydew or sooty mould on leaves, yellow spots on upper leaf surface, cast skins on leaves, curling of leaves, and distortion of new growth

7) Fruit fly:
Location = around your fruit bowl
o Fruit flies feed on fruit
Do you want these living in your house? Why not?
o No – they eat fruit!
Interesting Facts:
o Over 1,500 species of Drosophila in the world
o Useful to biologists (a model species) because they are small and thus take up little lab space, they are easily cultured, they have a short generation time, they are extremely fertile and they have easily observable phenotypes.
o Life cycle of Drosophila is made up of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult
o Eggs are laid in a food source such as a rotting fruit and develop into larvae after about a day.

8) Locust:
Location = your garden
Why does it live there?
o It eats your plants
Do you want these living in your house? Why not?
o No – they eat your plants!
Interesting Facts:
o Locusts outbreaks can destroy entire crops of food, which historically has led to famine
o There was a recent plague in West Africa, which led to food shortages because crops were destroyed

9) Wasp:
Location = Garden
o Nest is made up of chewed wood fibres mixed with saliva
o Wasps secrete a chemical to repel ants from the nest
o Adult wasps feed on nectar and sweet fruit, but bring insects and caterpillars to feed the larvae
(Really nice simple diagram showing life cycle of the wasp colony can be found at
<http://www.waspcontrol.co.uk/wasp-lifecycle.php> <span class="print-footnote">\[2\]</span>)

Interesting Facts:
o Cockroaches don’t like lights – they will run away from sources of light
o Cockroaches are nocturnal
o Cockroaches can survive without their heads for over a week - they breath through spiracles (holes in their exoskeleton) so don't suffocate without heads, but die of dehydration, they also don't bleed to death as they have open circulatory systems (unlike our high pressure systems)

17, 18, 19) See below

20) Slug
Location = Garden
Why does it live there?
o Some feed on the leaves of plants. Others feed on earthworms or other slugs
Do you want these living in your house? Why not?
o No - the eat your plants and leave slime trails everywhere
Interesting Facts:
o Slime is secreted to stop slugs from drying out (desiccating) and attracts water (hygroscopic)
o Slime trails can be used for slugs to find each other (e.g. for mating) or for carnivorous slugs to find slugs to eat
o Slime trails make it difficult and repulsive for predators to eat them
(o Humans control slugs by spraying nematodes (round worms) into the water, which then infect and kill the slugs. Slug pellets work differently causing the slugs to dehydrate - metaldehyde & methiocarb are the active ingredients in slug pellets. The first causes the slug to swell and the second causes damage to the mucus cells resulting in the over-production of mucus. (source the Naked Scientist)

**Parasites**
The kids will look at different parasites and learn how they cause disease in human/animal hosts.

Other things to talk about:
1) How are these parasites transmitted?
2) Where in the world are these diseases prevalent? Why?

Tips for demonstrating: Great for the "we've seen it all before" older kids.

17. ROUNDWORM:

R1) You can talk about how they live inside animals and sometimes humans - in their intestines.

R2) Ask the children if they know where their intestine is. If not, point to it on your body, and briefly explain what it is (food in through mouth, down into stomach, then into intestines, and out as poop).

R3) Then you could say that the life cycle for some human roundworms involves ingestion of eggs, hatching of eggs, the babies going out through your gut wall (because they're not big enough to live in the gut all on their own yet) and finding their way via the lymphatic system to the lungs.

R4) The baby roundworms aren't content to stay there, so they crawl up your lungs and "tickle," What would you do if something was tickling you inside your lungs? That's right, we cough the thing up. Then, once we've coughed, unless we spit out the phlegm, what do we do? We Swallow it.

R5) Roundworms go to intestine again, but by this time they're big, and they grow there.

R6) How do they grow? They eat. What do they eat? Your food in your intestines!

R7) How many do you think can live in your intestines? About 100 can live in one person.

R8) How do you think they make you feel? They can block your gut, cause pain, anaemia, and malnutrition.

R9) So - how do other people become infected? The roundworms produce lots of eggs, which you excrete in your feces (poop). If this gets on someone's hands/in their food (through poor sanitation/hygiene), they will get infected. Moral of the story: wash your hands after using the toilet!

18. FLATWORM (TAPEWORMS):

F1) Show the flatworm to the kids and explain that these flatworms infect cows and humans. How do they get infected?

F2) Show them the flatworm segments in the tube

F3) Explain that these segments are excreted in cow poop... because some of these segments are motile - they form a long sticky trail!

F4) Quite often, these segments are excreted onto grass, and another cow will become infected when it eats the grass.

19. LIVER FLUKES:

L1) These live in your liver, and make holes in it (like swiss cheese).

L2) How would this make you feel? Why do you need your liver? Explain how the liver detoxifies things that we eat, and without these toxins can build up in our body and harm us!

L3) The infection route is by eating of encysted juvenile form of the parasites. The parasites come out from the cyst when they reach intestine, then make their way to the liver and munch through for a living. Their eggs are released into environment with faeces.

L4) Animal infection with these parasite can cause troubles for sheep and cattle farming.

<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>Keep a careful eye on the tubes and magnifying glass, account for all specimen tubes every time a demonstration is completed. If necessary, reduce the number of tubes on display. Make sure all are tightly closed with sellotape on top of the seal to make it obvious that the tube should not be opened. Demonstrator must know the location of the nearest eyewash.
Make sure board is firmly attached to the desk, if not on the floor</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td>Call first aider in case of injury.<br />
Wash skin with that has come into contact with preservative with water. If preservative gets into eyes call a first aider. Use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and confident to do so.
Unless large quantities ingested, recommend that parents take child to GP if child becomes ill, and state that 1% propylene phenoxytol was the substance ingested.</td>
