Introduction

Explaining some of the key fetures of todays climate.

Explanation

Explanation: 

Betsy and I are trying to work out how to explain these important (and
different) concepts. Incidentally, it might also helpus with funding if
we have an environmental focus.

So, for global warming:

How about a light shining on two beakers with thermometers in them, with
one of them in a plastic bag? Thinking about it, we could try darker
plastic bags to show why people thought there might be global cooling,
too.

Ozone layer:

A bit more tricky. It would be great to get some sort of idea across
about the catalytic nature of ozone depletion. +
Also to explain what the bad effects of ozone are, eg. on skin, frogs,
plastics etc. Perhaps some model of how DNA gets broken by free UV
radiation...
