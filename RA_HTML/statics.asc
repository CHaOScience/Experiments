Explanation

Explanation: 

Doing various static electricity and magnetic experiments, to show their
properites and similarities.

- Playing with magents, they have North and south poles. +
-- The effect of magents on iron, iron filings etc

- Charging up balloons, and polystyrene, what do they do to other
things, do they always attract.

- applying a charged thing to corflour vegetable oil mix - it makes it
go hard in the same way as applying a magnet to iron filings makes them
go stiffer.

- ferrofluid, - we have some, you can make analagies if you like, it is
cool.

- charging things by earthing them near another charged thing

- Kelvin water drop experiment - this would be very good for smart alec
kids or parents, it charges up drops of water just by them falling by
electrostatic influence, it basically magnifies +

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Playing with magnets, and electrostatics, so charging
stuff up with your hair etc using ferrofluid, and looking at a kelvin
water drop electrostatic generator.

|RISKS a|
Strong magnets could finger trap, or shatter when colliding

Vegetable oil could cause a slip hazard if spilt

Kelvin drop model will spray drops of water up to a metre possibly
causing an electrical hazard

Kelvin drop model will generate enough voltage/charge to give a shock
smaller than you would get from a nylon jumper

ferrofluid stains horribly

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Only use one strong magnet at a time and cover in gaffer tape to absorb
collisions

Clear up any spills

Make sure that any electrical equipment/sockets nearby is covered with
plastic. Be aware of how far they are going.

Encourage children Not to touch it as it may hurt.

It should be in a container, don't open the container

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
case of injury.
|=======================================================================

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
