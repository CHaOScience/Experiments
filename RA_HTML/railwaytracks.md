Introduction
How the shape of wheels helps trains go round corners

Useful information
Kit List: 

- Large Board with tracks on it
- The four sets of wheels
(doesn't currently exist)

Explanation
Explanation: 

### Explanation

First get them to try and roll the flat wheels along the straight rails - it is just about possible if they are careful, but when they try on the curved track there is nothing keeping it on the rails...

Then maybe try the convex wheels, they should work a lot better. this is because when it goes slightly wrong to the right the left hand wheel effectively gets smaller, and the right hand bigger

So it will tend to turn left back into the track.

Then get them to try the blue convex wheels, these have the opposite effect if it goes wrong, the change in size of the wheels makee the problem worse...

<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>The effects of various wheel edge profiles on cornering is investigated.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>1. Finger trap between the track and wheels
2. Dropping one of the sets of wheels on a finger
3. Finger trap between base and the ground
4. Stray wheels may roll away causing a trip hazard</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>1. Ensure tracks are clear before testing a set of wheels.
2. Carry sets of wheels with both hands.
3. Try not to leave or let kids lean on the floor by the tracks whilst wheels are being investigated.
4. Catch wheels at the end of each round of testing; don't allow them to roll away unsupervised. Keep a track of each of the four sets of wheels, and if one is missing, locate it before continuing the experiment.</td>
