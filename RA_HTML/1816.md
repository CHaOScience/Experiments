Pentadactyl Limbs
=================

<span class="submitted">Fri, 12/02/2016 - 01:44 — Sarah</span>
Introduction
Looking at how form is linked with function with mammal limbs

Useful information
Kit List: 

Selection of animal forelimbs - borrowed from Zoology (rabbit, dog, mouse, sheep, turkey)
Set of laminated limb-shapes and bone formations
Pictures of animals

Explanation
Explanation: 

Matching up laminated shapes of animal limbs to laminated bone outlines and real bones themselves. Talking about common ancestry.

The same basic 5:2:1 bone structure is found in many different animal forelimbs ranging from human forearms, horses, bats, dolphins, rabbits and turkeys.

More details to follow.

(Only able to borrow the forelimbs for CBS)

If dropped, bones may fall on feet or shatter, causing cuts and other injuries.
Possible infection risk from bone if skin is cut by touching the bone
Possible 'papercuts' from laminated shapes</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>Remind children to handle bones carefully; in particular, warn not to stab each other with small bones.
Demonstrator only have a few bones present at a time to minimise risk of children picking up or playing/messing with the bones. Demonstrator to keep an eye on anybody holding bones. If a bone smashes, clear it up immediately with dustpan and brush. Any bones with sharp edges may need to be smoothed off or replaced.
These bone specimens have been borrowed from the Zoology Department and are safe for handling. Please note, however, this does not necessarily mean that the skulls are completely sterile now.
Smooth off the corners on the laminate shapes, and be aware of children waving the shapes around, warning them not to.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td>In case of injury call first aider.
Warn parents of the possibility of infection if a child does cut him/herself on the bones; Advise parents to take child to a doctor if the cut looks infected.
In case of injury call first aider.</td>
