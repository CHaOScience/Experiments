Explanation

Explanation: 

There are lots of things to do, there are 2 nice stories, going through
the generation and motors stuff, and some extra odds and ends. You
shouldn't usually attempt to get through all of this in one go!

[[generating-power]]
1. Generating Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are 3 different power generating bits, in increasing level of
usefulness.

*Magnet, coil and ammeter*

This has a coil of copper wire attached to a small ammeter. When you
wave a magnet through the hole in the middle of the wire you get a
reading on the wire. Some things to talk about/do with it are:

* What are the objects? Coil is made of copper wire, this is a good
electrical conductor. The setup as a whole is an electrical circuit
(components linked together in a circuit). The meter looks like it might
measure something (cf weighing scales), it measures the amount of
electrical current (or just electricity) going round the circuit.
* Do we get more electricity by moving fast or slow? Does it work if
we're not moving at all?
* Is this very much electricity? The scale on the ammeter is microamps
(the funny squiggle is the Greek letter mu), talking (or asking
questions about) millimetres, metres and kilometres is a good warm-up to
explaining that microamps is a small unit. Older kids might know that
fuses have amp ratings on them.
* What do the positive/negative readings mean? It tells us which way the
electricity is going round the circuit, notice that it changes if we
move magnet in a different direction, or swap north/south poles.
* How can we get more electricity? Good ideas are moving faster (and
moving in circles is easier than up/down), stronger magnet or more
coils.

This then leads nicely onto the next bit...

*Rotating generator (green)*

This has most of the improvements suggested above (show to them the
larger magnet, more coils), and if you spin the handle fast enough it
will give you enough electricity to light a bulb. Things to talk about:

* The faster you spin it, the brighter it is.
* Does it matter which way round you turn it? No.
* [more advanced]If the bulb is an LED rather than a filament bulb then
it will only light half of the time, with frequency=rate of turning the
handle. This is because the current is alternating ('going backwards and
forwards') and it only lights when the current is going one way.

*Generator in a box*

This is a better version of the previous one, but it's all hidden in a
box which means visitors can't see what is going on as well. There are
two bulbs that can be switched on or off, and also a voltmeter/ammeter.
Things to do:

* Start someone off turning the handle and then increase the wattage of
bulbs turned on gradually. They will find that it gets harder to turn as
you do this. Talk about needing to put extra energy in to get more light
out (the energy is coming from them, *not* from the magnet/coil which
just convert kinetic/moving energy into electrical energy)
* Power generation: How many watts are the bulbs you have at home? If
it's this hard to turn a handle to make 10W of bulbs light, how hard
would it be to power all the bulbs in your house? How about all the
bulbs, TVs,... in town X? This is really where our power comes from,
what better ways are there of turning the handle (wind farms are the
easiest example for small kids)
* [More advanced]Look at the ammeter/voltmeter. When a bulb is fully lit
how do those readings compare to the wattage of the bulb (P=IV).

[[dropping-magnets]]
2. Dropping magnets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This uses the last part to do a neat trick. +
The three columns in the coin drop are made of plastic, aluminium and
metal ???. None of these are magnetic, but a coin magnet will fall more
slowly through the metals.

This is because the moving magnet is inducing an electrical current in
the metal (like the magnet past the coil in part 1). There are two ways
to explain why this causes it to slow down:

1.  [easier]Some energy is needed to make the electrical current (like
turning the handle before). This time the energy comes from the falling
magnet, and when it loses kinetic energy it slows down.
2.  [harder]Eddy currents of electricity are formed, and these create an
electromagnetic effect opposing the motion of the magnet, hence it slows
down.

You can also do this with the perspex and copper pipes (get a volunteer
to hold the pipe, with their other hand below it to catch the magnet),
the slowing effect with the copper pipe is really huge.

There is also green 'iron filing' paper, which shows up the movement of
a magnet through it. You can use this to 'see' the movement of the
magnet inside the copper pipe.

[[motors-etc]]
3. Motors etc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are various bits here, you probably won't want to do all of them.
This is the opposite of what we have been doing so far. Now we are using
electricity to make magnets, or electricity and magnets to make
something move.

*Compasses around a magnet/wire*

Show what a magnet/current carrying wire do to a compass, compare the
two.

*Electromagnetic Nail*

Wrap wire around a nail attach it to a power supply and see how it
affects paper clips, with and without the power, try picking up a
matchbox car as a use for electromagnets.

*Jumping Wire with indicator lights*

Put a current through the wire on top of the magnet, you should notice
the wire is pushed by the magnet. If you reverse the direction of the
current the direction of the force reverses.

*Simple motor*

This is a simple toy motor. There are two commutators one which keeps
the polarity the same - you can show that you can get some movement but
not rotation, and one which swaps the polarity, that will make it turn
nicely.

-Have a look at the motor there are a load of wires near some magnets,
so there will probably be some forces going on from the Jumping wire
experiment.

-Using the first commutator, you need to keep swapping the polarity as
when the motor gets half way round the direction of the current has
essentially reversed (you are using the other half of the coil), so it
gets pushed back again. You can get it to keep turning, by reversing the
current. This however gets a little tedious...

Luckly the second solves the problem, everytime the motor turns halfway
round the two contacts swap, so it keeps turning. This is how all DC
motors work, some AC ones use the changing direction of the voltage
instead of a commutator, so have fixed speeds.

Tricks: It works best on the 7.5V range with the motor wired from the
+ve side to the -ve side. The brushes should be touching the commutator,
on either side (top and bottom won't work)

There is a real motor in the box too, which you can compare it to.

DESCRIPTION

Lots of experiments about magnetism and electromagnetism

RISKS

1. Overheating of coils/wire -> burns

2. Powerful magnets shattering

3. Rotating motor could be dangerous

4. Visitor or demonstrator catching fingers in generator as they turn
the handle on the generator

5. Motor connections can short-circuit and get hot.

6. Copper pipe hitting people in face.

7. Heavy Generators and Motors could fall and hit someone.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS

1. Do not put too much current through a coil/wire, if it is getting
hot, turn it down

2. Warn visitors if you give them a magnet.

* Use the minimum number of free magnets
* Keep the magnets under control
* Cover with tape to reduce impact, and contain any shards
* Pad edges of magnet to reduce finger trap

3. Keep kids' fingers away - if it needs pushing it should be done on
the axle, not the armature

4. Place generator on flat surface so visitors can't catch their fingers
underneath so easily.

* Tell visitors to hold only the rotating part of the generator handle
and not the entire handle.
* Keep control of the visitors at all times and don't let them get
overexcited while turning the handle

5. Demonstrator to turn off power supply to motor when not in use

6. Demonstrator should hold pipe for younger kids and monitor use for
others.

7. Use clamps to keep generators and motor firmly attached to table.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT

1. If there is a burn, run under cold water for ten minutes, call a
first aider

2. Call first aider in case of injury

3. Call first aider in case of injury

4. Call first aider in case of injury

5. Turn off electricity at mains. Call first aider in case of injury.

6. Call first aider in event of injury.

7. Call first aider in event of injury.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
