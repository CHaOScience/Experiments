Introduction

Looking at how form is linked with function with mammal limbs

Useful information

Kit List: 

Selection of animal forelimbs - borrowed from Zoology (rabbit, dog,
mouse, sheep, turkey) +
Set of laminated limb-shapes and bone formations +
Pictures of animals

Explanation

Explanation: 

Matching up laminated shapes of animal limbs to laminated bone outlines
and real bones themselves. Talking about common ancestry.

The same basic 5:2:1 bone structure is found in many different animal
forelimbs ranging from human forearms, horses, bats, dolphins, rabbits
and turkeys.

More details to follow.

(Only able to borrow the forelimbs for CBS)

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Comparing real animal forelimbs to laminate limb shapes

|RISKS a|
Some bones may have sharp tips.

If dropped, bones may fall on feet or shatter, causing cuts and other
injuries.

Possible infection risk from bone if skin is cut by touching the bone

Possible 'papercuts' from laminated shapes

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Remind children to handle bones carefully; in particular, warn not to
stab each other with small bones.

Demonstrator only have a few bones present at a time to minimise risk of
children picking up or playing/messing with the bones. Demonstrator to
keep an eye on anybody holding bones. If a bone smashes, clear it up
immediately with dustpan and brush. Any bones with sharp edges may need
to be smoothed off or replaced.

These bone specimens have been borrowed from the Zoology Department and
are safe for handling. Please note, however, this does not necessarily
mean that the skulls are completely sterile now.

Smooth off the corners on the laminate shapes, and be aware of children
waving the shapes around, warning them not to.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
In case of injury call first aider.

Warn parents of the possibility of infection if a child does cut
him/herself on the bones; Advise parents to take child to a doctor if
the cut looks infected.

In case of injury call first aider.
