Explanation

Explanation: 

Demonstrates why we see the different phases of the moon, introduces the
concept of eclipses and planets as reflective surfaces and extends this
to different ways to detect exoplanets.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Understanding the phases of the moon, eclipses and how we
can use this to detect exoplanets. In development but will contain a
combination of balls to represent planets, and probably torches to
represent stars and far off planets. May contain darkened glasses to
reduce the effect of ambient light.

|RISKS |1. Trip hazard if balls are dropped or left to roll about +
 +
2. Light shining in the eyes +
 +
3. Disorientation wearing or taking off dark glasses +
 +
4. After months of no use, batteries dying inside torches, and possibly
leaking

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Balls to be kept int box
between uses. Care taken that children do not drop or bounce balls.
Children should be instructed to walk not run at all times in the
experiment. +
 +
2. Torches used will not be excessively bright, and children will only
be encouraged to look at them for brief periods. +
 +
3. Ensure surrounding area is clear so they cannot stumble over
anything. Check that children are still relatively able to see when
wearing the glasses. Don't leave them on for extended periods and be
aware it may take a little while for eyes to readjust when taking them
on and off. +
4. Check Batteries inside torches at the start of each day. Ensure no
obvious signs of damage

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |If children become
disorientated make sure they stand still and/or sit down until they have
regained their composure. +
Call first aider in event of injury
