Useful information

Kit List: 

At least two different colours of laser pointer. +
Diffraction gratings/CD DVD segments. +
Ripple tank. +
Shive wave machine (made from duct tape, skewers and weights). +
Slinky. +
Bubble wand (piece of wire bent into a loop) + bubble liquid. +
Glass/perspex prism. +
Polarising filters. +
Torch.

Explanation

Explanation: 

I won't necessarily use all these demonstrations in the talk:

\A) Polarisation: essentially a copy of the most basic part of the
polarisation experiment, rotating two polarising filters.

\B) Shive wave machine: two long duck tape strips stuck together with
skewers sandwiched between at regular intervals. Weights are attached to
the skewer ends. This is used as a wave model to demonstrate some basic
characteristics.

\C) Walking people model of refraction: use a line of volunteers walking
at a regular pace to demonstrate what happens to a wavefront at an
imaginary interface.

\D) Refraction: shine a laser/white light through a prism to demonstrate
refraction.

\E) Use a slinky to demonstrate interference and standing waves.

\F) Make bubbles/bubble films and relate colours being observed to
standing waves in the film.

\G) Ripple tank: used to demonstrate diffraction from a double slit or
airy-type pattern formed if the tank is round.

\H) Diffraction gratings: used to demonstrate that light diffraction is
equivalent to what was observed in the ripple tank.

\I) Get the audience to make a Mexican wave.

Risk Assessment

Risk Assessment: 

\A) +
Risks: +
Shining a torch in audience members' eyes. +
Action to minimise: +
Be aware of where torch is shining, don't aim at front few rows of
audience. +
If accident: +
Might be dazzled, no permanent damage.

\B) +
Risks: +
Sharp skewers hurting demonstrators/volunteers. +
Weights falling off and falling on people. +
Duck tape snapping under tension. +
Wave machine hitting people whilst in motion. +
Action to minimise: +
Blunt skewer ends. +
Ensure weights properly fixed on. +
Test limit of duck tape strength prior to demonstration. +
Control number and location of audience volunteers. +
If accident: +
Call first aider.

\C) +
Risks: +
Volunteers tripping up. +
Volunteers running/out of control. +
Action to minimise: +
Ensure area clear of trip hazards prior to talk starting. +
Terminate demonstration if it gets out of control. +
If accident: +
Call first aider.

\D) +
Risks: +
Prism breaking: sharp glass. +
Eye injury from laser beam. +
Action to minimise: +
No volunteers and may want to place prism on a flat surface instead of
holding it. +
Use <= class II lasers: blink reflex should protect eyes, make sure to
shine away from audience. +
If accident: +
Ensure shards of prism are collected/contained before continuing. +
Call first aider in case of injury.

\E) +
Risks: +
Fingers getting caught/cut by metal slinky. +
Slinky hitting people. +
Action to minimise: +
Tape slinky ends and ensure volunteer knows where/how to hold. +
Ensure area used for slinky demonstration is clear of people. +
If accident: +
Call first aider in event of injury.

\F) +
Risks: +
Audience members allergic to washing up liquid. +
Slip hazard is spilt. +
Sharp edges on bubble wand. +
Action to minimise: +
Check with audience/blow bubbles so that they don't land on audience. +
Ensure container is on stable, elevated surface. +
Check and tape any sharp edges prior to use. +
If accident: +
Call first aider in event of injury. +
Mop up spillages promptly.

\G) +
Risks: +
Slip hazard if water split. +
Allergic reaction to any dyes used. +
Cutting on shards of glass/perspex if tank breaks. +
Action to minimise: +
Ensure container is on stable, elevated base. +
Check dyes prior to use, don't let audience members do this part. +
Ensure container is on a stable surface and don't move it during talk. +
If accident: +
Mop up spillages promptly. +
Call first aider in event of injury. +
Clear up/contain glass shards.

\H) +
Risks: +
Eye injury from laser. +
Action to minimise: +
Use <= class II lasers: blink reflex should protect eyes, make sure to
shine away from audience. +
(test grating prior to talk to identify light paths) +
If accident: +
Call first aider in event of injury.

\I) +
Risks: +
Audience members falling over. +
Action to minimise: +
Check space in front of seats in lecture theatre before talk. +
If accident: +
Call first aider in event of injury.
