Explanation

Explanation: 

So I challenge you to build a tree from the bits and pieces I have here,
now where are you going to start?

*Trunk* here we have two different kinds of straws and they transport
two different kinds of things - what do trees need to transport around
themselves? Firstly what do they need to get out of the soil? - water
and minerals. And can you think of anything that the tree needs to
transport down from the top of the tree to the roots? Or what gets made
at/happens the top of the tree? - sugar or food/photosynthesis. The
thicker straws are used for sucking up water, they have to be really
thick and strong to stop the straws collapsing under the negative
tension that pulls the water up from the soil.

*Roots* keep the tree upright, help it get nutrients and water out of
the ground, have a different pattern/structure depending upon
nutrient/water availability. If there is less of something important the
roots will be longer and less furry (fewer root hairs and smaller
surface area) to try and grow into a space with more of that nutrient.
See picture of white lupin grown with (left) and without (right)
phosphate.

*Branches* spread the leaves out to maximise sunlight captured, trying
not to shade out own leaves below, supporting the canopy. Trees will
grow with different branch patterns depending on their surroundings e.g.
open field vs forest - see sketch of the white oak trees (Quercus alba,
sketches by C. Holdrege). Shade avoidance; neighboring plants are
detected by the proportion of red to far red light in the available
light, red light gets depleted and the trees reduce branch production

*Leaves* to capture the light! Needed for photosynthesis, making food
(forming the base of the food chain - primary producer), different
shapes have different benefits (sun vs shade leaves, needles vs broad
leaves, we know a v.limited amount about the reason for the huge
variation in broad leaf shape). Encourage the kids to think about what
benefits different shapes have; drip tips - allowing water to run off
the leaves quickly, so water doesn't pool and permit fungal growth;
banana leaves - have

*Bark* protects the transport straws/vessels within the trunk, insulates
from heat/fire (cork bark), protects from insect damage and diseases.

Et voila! We have a tree!

Can talk about different tree shapes - conifers vs decidious trees (e.g.
snow collecting on branches and damaging them or sliding off)
oaks/beeches tend to have taller and thinner canopies than those in
mixed canopies.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Building a model tree from craft materials

|RISKS a|
Sharp ended pipe cleaners may scratch.

Eyes may be poked if children are silly with the straws.

Elastic bands may be used as missiles or wound tightly round fingers,
cutting off blood supply.

Germ transfer from putting straws in mouths.

Use of scissors

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Fold over the tips and warn children about scratches.

Encourage children to be sensible with straws, ask them to leave if they
are being silly.

Encourage children to be sensible with elastic bands, ask to leave if
they won't.

Warn children not to put straws in mouths, wash or dispose of any straws
which have been eaten.

Younger children should be accompanied by an adult. CHaOS volunteers to
oversee carefully.Ensure kids are behaving sensibly at all times. Use
safety scissors.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
In case of injury call first aider.

In case of injury call first aider.

In case of injury call first aider.

Warn parents of the possibility of germ transfer if child has been
eating straws.

In case of injury call first aider.
