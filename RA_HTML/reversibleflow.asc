started.

Useful information

Kit List: 

* Two concentric cylinders with a gap in between and a handle to rotate
the inner cylinder (Couette geometry)
* Golden syrup - enough so that the depth of golden syrup is a good
couple of inches.
* Anything like icing sugar for "drawing" on the surface of the syrup.
Helps if it's edible because people will want to lick their hands!

Packing Away: 

Clean up well, the golden syrup should be disposed of in a bin.

Explanation

Explanation: 

This experiment demonstrates the ideas of time reversability in fluid
flow.

It consists of two concentric cylinders that can be rotated relative to
one another, with the space between the cylinders filled with syrup.
Using icing sugar, draw a picture or write an initial on the surface of
the syrup. Turn the inner cylinder about one rotation, and see the
picture get stretched and maybe even vanish. Now rotate the inner
cylinder back again (slowly!) and watch your picture come back. Simple!

[[what-to-do]]
What to do
~~~~~~~~~~

Put three cans of golden syrup in the white bucket. Sprinkle some of the
icing sugar(or similar) in a straight radial line on the surface of the
syrup. Whilst holding the bottom of the bucket firmly, get the children
to SLOWLY turn the handle to rotate the inner cylinder (say 90°). Then
get them to rotate it back slowly. The powder should be in the same
pattern as initially.

[[how-to-explain-it]]
How to explain it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine the syrup as little blobs of syrup. When you turn the inner
cylinder they experience a force and so move. When you turn the cylinder
back, they experience the same magnitude of force but pushing them in
the opposite direction. So in the end it's as if they never moved at
all.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A fish which swims in water by wiggling its tail from side to side
wouldn't get anywhere if you put it in syrup. Moving the tail one way
and then the other in syrup just puts the fluid back where it started,
with no forward push. Sperm get round this by having a spiral tail which
rotates, so their swimming motion is never 'reversed' and they can
travel forwards.

[[what-are-we-seeing]]
What are we seeing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'The syrup is sticky so all the bits next to each other stay together' -
close...

If the syrup is deep enough and the turning was not too fast, the flow
has very little turbulence. This is not just because the syrup is
"sticky" - if you turn too fast you will lose the picture no matter how
sticky the syrup is! How a flow behaves depends not only on the
stickiness of the fluid, but also on speed of flow (and density of flow
and lengthscales). In the case of very low Reynolds number and nice
boundary conditions, reversing the boundary conditions reverses the flow
almost exactly - which is why the picture comes back almost exactly and
why flapping fish can't swim in golden syrup.

[[science-background]]
Science background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Golden syrup has a very high viscosity, so the flow should be laminar.
It is the little bit of turbulence that is unavoidable that will mean
that you will have to occasionally clean it out and put fresh syrup in!
The slowly is to minimise turbulence. This causes turbulent mixing which
stops the demonstration working.

[[other-things-to-talk-about]]
Other things to talk about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics (e.g. Reynolds number, etc.) and
how these can be used to describe flow in systems of completely
different size, but same dimensionless number.

*Some background information from 'Chemistry & Industry' 02/01/06*

*Mixtures are Reversible by Lisa Richards* +
"When you were making your Christmas pudding last month, did you
consider that if you chose to stir the mixture anti-clockwise, not only
are you breaking a tradition and giving yourself bad luck, you may also
have caused the mixture to separate rather than combine?

As crazy as this may sound, it has been discovered that two liquids
seemingly irreversibly mixed can be returned to their original
components.

David Pine and his team at the University of California describe this
phenomenon as the 'equivalent to reversing time' (Nature 2005,438,997).

Using two concentric cylinders and tiny beads suspended in solution,
Pine and his colleagues showed that, when stirred in reverse, the beads
retrace their movements and return to their starting positions.

Troy Shinbrot, of Rutgers Univsersity, New Jersey, believes that this
has great implications for pharmaceuticals. Shinbrot explained that
viscous fluids such as honey have been known to have this property for
some time, but it was generally assumed that suspensions behave
irreversibly. Many pharmaceutical preparations are sold as suspensions,
for example children's antibiotics such as Amoxicillin. Understanding
mixing behaviour helps in the understanding of which suspensions will
mix, and the way in which this occurs.

Applications such as tissue engineering performed on carrier particles,
or cell cultures grown in viscous, slowly agitated sugar solutions, may
also benefit from this new knowledge."

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Having a container of golden syrup and shearing it by
rotating a handle

|RISKS a|
Equipment is heavy when filled with golden syrup

Ingestion/ inhaling of golden syrup/ icing sugar that's been in a lab
environment

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Make sure equipment is secure on a flat surface
