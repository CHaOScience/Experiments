Useful information

Kit List: 

Periodic Table of elements +
Molymod kits - general, graphite, diamond +
Sample of Graphite (pencil lead), maybe some others

Frequency of use: 

1

Explanation

Explanation: 

Start of by discussing the periodic table, and how the valency of a
compound can be determined from this.

Introduce Covalent, Ionic and metalic bonding. Using the diagrams
provided in the kit. Also refer to the samples of each provided. i,e
metals ductile as structure can rearrange and electron cloud can move
with it. Whereas covalent bonding is directional so if broken snaps.
Metals conduct electricity as deloacalised electrons in the sea of
electrons. Ionic compounds form strongly bonded salts, can explain
solvation and why they dissolve in solution.

Then introduce the diamond and graphite structures. Ask them what they
know about diamond, most should know it is the hardest material on
earth. Ask them from looking at the structures to say which they think
it is and why. Explain that it clearly isn't the graphite as the layers
easily slide over each other. Then introduce graphite as pencil lead, so
say this is how it writes layers of graphite slide over each other some
onto the paper. If people still follow talk explain that there is a free
electron from each C between the layers. These are delocalised so can
conduct electricity. Next take a piece of graphite and show that you can
put charge through it.

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Use Molymods and periodic table, along with samples of
materials to explain the properties of various materials.

|RISKS |1) Choking on small parts +
2) Electric charge through graphite

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1) Watch carefully over children,
use preassembled models so fewer small parts +
2) Use small charge

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1) Encourage child to
cough, call first aider
