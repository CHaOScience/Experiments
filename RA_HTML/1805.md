Niches and speciation
=====================

<span class="submitted">Wed, 03/02/2016 - 16:07 — Sarah</span>
Introduction
Public summary: 

Seeing how different sized bird beaks will result in speciation based on food availability

Useful information
Kit List: 

Set of silicon 'beaks' (oven mitts which open with different appetures)
Beads/balls
Pots/dishes

Explanation
Explanation: 

**Set up and activity**
Place the different sized beads in the pots at different locations on the table.
Offer the group the selection of silicon beaks.
Challenge them to pick up as much 'food' (the beads) as possible in a minute (or longer if this time period is too short). Then ask them to stand by the pot which they were most successful at picking up the beads from.

**Explanation**
\*\*\*Not finished, at all!\*\*\*The group should be split between the different pots depending on which beak they have been using. Talk about how different organsims are more successful in different environments - natural selection and survival of the fittest. Darwin's finches are a really good example of this.

Keep bead pots away from edge of table, discourage boisterous behaviour
Ask if anyone has a silicon allergy before giving oven mitts
Discourage boisterous behaviour, and use plastic pots rather than glass.</td>

Sweep up beads as soon as they spill, call first aider in case of a fall
Call first aider
Clear up broken items promptly. Call first aider in case of injury</td>
