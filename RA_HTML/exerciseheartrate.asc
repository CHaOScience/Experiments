Useful information

Kit List: 

Stopwatch. +
(When done on tour, this experiment is often integrated with the
Stethoscopes experiment. The Stethoscope experiment requires
stethoscopes and antibacterial wipes/disinfectant and tissue, and also
lives in a small blue box, often with the stopwatches. If using the
stethoscopes, ensure you read the separate risk assessment for
Stethoscopes).

Packing Away: 

Lives in one of the small blue medic boxes.

Frequency of use: 

5

Explanation

Explanation: 

Check for asthma. If child is asthmatic, check with parents about
severity, and if the child can do five minutes of fairly heavy-impact
exercise. If they can do it, ensure they have an inhaler, and ensure
they don't push themselves too far.

Take child's pulse (radial side of forearm), and write it down.

Make child run on the spot 3 mins and then do starjumps for 3 mins or
any other combination of the above.

Check pulse again.

There should be a difference. If not, it's an anomaly, and you can make
them do the experiment again.

If you're doing this experiment by taking the radial pulse, you need to
start by asking questions (like "Have you had your pulse taken
before/seen it done on TV?" and "Why do doctors take your pulse?" to
make sure they know that your pulse reflects your heart rate, and if
they don't, make sure to explain it before carrying on!

So, why does your heart rate go up?

What is the heart for? +
-They will usually say say pumping blood around the body/beating. My
favourite question after this is "What is blood for?", to which the
answer is always "It keeps you alive". You can then progress from here
by asking why (which they often will not know, even in surprisingly old
children), and then explaining why we need blood. I usually go along the
lines of "What do we need to do to stay alive?", get them to work out
that we need to breathe, eat and drink, then think about where air and
food go into our bodies, and then how might we be able to transport
these things from your lungs/stomach to wherever they're needed, like
your muscles to jump around or your brain to think - and then you have
ended up working out what blood does! (You can use the analogy of lots
of lorries (blood cells) driving along roads (blood vessels) carrying
cargo (oxygen/food). You can go further into the idea of cells needing
energy from glucose and oxygen with older/interested kids.)

- With older/interested children you can then develop the idea by
talking about the heart as a double pump and the pulmonary and systemic
circulatory systems. This works well if you've got the heart model to
hand (on tour), or if someone else has just explained the heart model to
them!

-Then you can talk about how your muscles are more active when you're
doing exercise so they need more 'fuel' (oxygen and glucose), therefore
you need to get more blood to them in a shorter space of time, therefore
the heart beats faster!

-You can also talk about breathing rate (are they panting?) and recovery
times and fitness if you wish to. You need to breathe at a higher rate
and more deeply to get more oxygen into your lungs, and then move it to
the muscles more quickly, because they need more energy and so are using
up oxygen faster.

(N.B. I find this experiment is quite useful with groups of lively
children, as provided you can get them to be reasonably sensible and you
have enough space, they can jump up and down until they're quite tired
and then they will often sit down calmly and listen to the explanation
afterwards!)

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Heart rate before and after up to 6mins of exercise

|RISKS a|
1. Asthma attack

2. Child running into things/people

3. Physical injury eg. falling

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Check child's asthma status with parent or with teacher (or with
child itself if old enough) before doing experiment. Do not allow child
to exercise if asthma is severe, and DO NOT ALLOW AN ASTHMATIC CHILD TO
DO EXPERIMENT IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN INHALER.

2. Make sure exercise area is clear, use on-the-spot exercise e.g. star
jumps if space is limited

3. Demonstrator to ensure floor area is clear and dry. If area becomes
wet, locate a mop and dry the area.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1. Sit child down, keep them calm, locate inhaler for child to
self-administer. Call first aider.

2. Call first aider in case of injury

3. Call first aider in case of injury
