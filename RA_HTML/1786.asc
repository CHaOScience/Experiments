Introduction

A challenge to get people thinking about animal intelligence

Useful information

Kit List: 

Currently this is scavenged from Slug Bubbles and whatever you can find
lying around. +
Large tube with bung (from Slug Bubbles) +
Jug (from Slug Bubbles) +
Water +
Gravel/stones (several handfuls, you need to find this) +
Balloon with pipe cleaner hook attached (balloons should be in stores,
pipe cleaners in Pipe Cleaner Neurons) +
Twigs +
Straws (from Stores) +
Tent pegs (from Camping Stores)

Explanation

Explanation: 

Set up the challenge

Partially fill the tube with water +
Float the partially inflated balloon in the tube with the pipe cleaner
hook pointing upwards

What you could say: +
We're going to think about intelligence here. To start off with, can
anyone tell me what intelligence is? 'how clever someone is' Ok, great
and how do we normally find out how intelligent someone is? 'IQ test,
asking really difficult questions' Right, so this is how intelligence
tests normally work for humans [insert some information about IQ tests
and other intelligence tests for humans (see below)] but what about if
you wanted to test the intelligence of an animal? 'you could get all
sorts of crazy answers here, write them down!' We can set practical
tests to find out how well animals understand the world works, quite
often these look a bit like the challenge I have here:

Your challenge is to get the balloon out of the tube using the objects
here [give them the gravel, straws, pegs etc and let them play
around/experiment with trying to get the balloon out, the easiest way to
do this is the raise the water lever by carefully dropping gravel in to
raise the water level].

Whether successful or not congratulate for valiant effort, then ask: So
you managed (or didn't manage...) to get the balloon out, do you think
that any other animals would be able to do so too? Which ones? -
primates and birds match us most closely for intelligence, by using
stones to make the water level and the balloon rise it shows that they
understand that water is displaced when things are dropped into it. Do
you think that a bird would want to try and get this balloon out of this
particular tube? 'no, not really' You're right, it probably wouldn't
really be interested in getting this tiny little balloon, so we need to
design experiments that are relevant to that animal, what do you think a
bird might be more interested than the balloon?' - food! [same
experiment with a floating grape]

If demonstrating with Animal skulls, the magpie and pigeon are good to
use here. The cranial cavity is a good indicator of brain size. Brains
use lots of the body’s resources, so animals will only have big brains
if they need them. Intelligence can be linked to brain size, but we have
to also look at the size of the animal. Bigger animals have bigger
brains because they have to deal with more (unconscious) processes in
the body. So we have to compare animals of a similar size: in this case
magpie and pigeon. Magpie has the bigger brain, which suggests it is
more intelligent, which is correct. +
(For older audiences: We use the Encephalisation Quotient. This compares
a species’ actual brain size to its expected brain size, given its body
size, to give a rough estimate of intelligence. It’s not entirely
reliable however, and generally works better for mammals than other
animals.)

More information for older audiences/background for demonstrators:

The experiment we did is a way of measuring specifically ‘Physical
Intelligence’. This is how well an animal can understand physical
objects, such as information about an object’s properties (size, shape,
weight); and objects’ relationship with each other/the environment, such
as whether or not an object of a particular size will fit in a
particular space. It also goes on to include insightful use of tools and
objects when solving problems. Problem solving via conditioning and
blind trial-and-error are not considered to be indicators of
intelligence. +
Tool use (an external object used as an extension of an animal’s body to
attain a goal) and especially tool manufacture are used as indicators of
higher levels of physical intelligence.

Human intelligence:

Intelligence is more than just how 'clever' you are - it measures
various aspects of cognitive ability (and the actual definition can
depend on which psychologist you ask!). +
There are many different types of intelligence, such as Gf (fluid
intelligence; reasoning and solving novel problems), Gc (crystallised
intelligence; ability to use skills, knowledge and experience), Gv
(visual processing), Gs (processing speed) and many more. There is a
general factor ‘g’ that is thought to underlie all of these. +
Different IQ tests test different types (or combination of types) of
intelligence. Currently, the most commonly used intelligence test is the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children (WISC) which measure several types of intelligence.
Other tests include the Stanford-Binet and Ravens’ Matrices. The scales
are ranked ordinally, with 100 being the average score, 1 SD is 15
points, 2 SDs are 30 points etc.

Animal cognition:

Why is assessing animal cognition difficult? +
1. Animals can show complex patterns of behaviour that don’t actually
involve cognition. An example is fixed action patterns that can be seen
in digger wasps. When bringing food back to the nest, the wasp will
place the cricket in a specific position outside the nest, go in to
inspect the nest, then come back out and retrieve the cricket to bring
into the nest. If the cricket is moved during the inspection stage even
just a tiny amount, when the wasp comes to retrieve it, it must repeat
the behaviour from the start (ie. place cricket, inspect nest, retrieve
cricket) +
2. Behaviours can seem human-like even when they are not, such as in the
case of Clever Hans, a horse that appeared to be able to count and
perform arithmetic, when in fact it was using subtle body language cues
from the trainer (who was unaware of making them) to determine the
correct answer

How is it assessed then? +
1. Comparative psychology: artificial tasks in the lab, using a few
representative species +
2. Ethology: Observing natural (or semi-naturalistic) behaviours in
animals, in a wide variety of species +
Good studies use both approaches.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Hooking a small object out of a tube

|RISKS a|
Injury from tent peg/hook/pipecleaners/gravel

Illness from ingesting the dirty water

Water spilt on the floor, causing a slip hazard

Gravel - either being eaten or thrown

The tube could fall over, get someone wet or hit someone

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Warn children to be careful and not grab the
pegs/hooks/pipecleaners/gravel

Ensure the children don't drink the water or splash it in each other's
faces, tell them not to put the straws in their mouths

Don't carry out experiment near a thoroughfare and be careful when
emptying/refilling the tube, don't let the children add too much gravel
at once

Don't give gravel to really small children, confiscate if they are
getting silly and throwing it

Demonstrator hold tube upright or tie to a table leg

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
Call first aider

Spit out water and rinse out mouth with clean water, call first aider

Mop up any spilt water as soon as possible

Call first aider

Call first aider
