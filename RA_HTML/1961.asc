Introduction

Public summary: 

CBS Talk 2017

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

CBS Talk 2017

Explanation

Explanation: 

Demos: +
• Model planets, possibly held up by volunteers +
• Squeezing/stretching a squash ball or elastic band to show heating
effect +
• Getting volunteers to orbit one another, one holding a torch to
illustrate day/night and year +
• Passing planets in front of a lamp to simulate transits +
• Swinging a ball on a rope to show how Newton’s third law causes a star
to wobble +
• Shining a laser pointer through a diffraction grating to show how
spectra are taken +
• Cooling water in two different sized beakers to show that high surface
area to volume ratio cools things quicker

Risk Assessment: 

*RISK* +

*ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE* +

*ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT*

Tripping or falling on dropped planets or squash ball +

If using volunteers, ask them not to throw balls or run after them. +

If ball dropped, demonstrator (not audience) to pick up immediately. In
case of accident contact first aider.

Swallowing of or choking on small parts used for some planets +

Don’t give small planets to children. +

In case of ingestion, call first aider.

Torch being shone in eyes +

Use a fairly low power LED torch as these are safe, ask children to keep
it away from eyes. +

If someone is dazzled by lights, switch off lights and sit them down
until they have recovered. Check they are ok before letting them walk
around again!

Lamp being shone in eyes +

Use a screen between lamp and audience +

If someone is dazzled, then switch off lights and ensure they are ok.

Lamp screen falling over +

Secure to table and not too near edge. Be careful not to knock. +

In case of accident, call first aider.

Tripping, falling or feeling dizzy when emulating orbits/diurnal
rotation +

Ensure that actions are carried out slowly e.g. by walking, not
running +

If dizziness occurs, sit down until recovered. Call first aider in event
of injury.

Scalding/burning from hot water +

Let water cool to lukewarm before using in demo. Do not overfill vessels
and leave away from edges of tables. Do not handle hot vessels. +

In case of scalds/burns contact first aider.

Spillages of water +

Leave vessels away from edges of tables where they might be knocked,
only handle if comfortable temperature. +

If spillage occurs, dry up immediately if safe temperature or cordon off
area until safe to do so.

Breaking of glassware or thermometers +

Leave vessels away from edges of tables, make sure thermometers will not
topple or roll before leaving. +

Clear up any breakages and spillages. In case of injury or contact with
thermometer contents, call first aider.

Elastic band snapping – unlikely possibility of injury +

Encourage volunteers not to over stretch bands +

In unlikely event of injury, contact first aider.

Swinging ball on rope: potential for ball to fly off / rope to snap. +

Only have demonstrator do this – make sure rope securely attached to
hand by wrist strap. Perform in lots of space and keep low. +

If causes breakage – clear up any dangers. +
If causes injury then contact first aider.

Electrical Hazards – potentially kettle, lamp +

See electrical parts RA +

See electrical parts RA

Laser pointer being shone in eyes +

Only allow demonstrator to touch the laser pointers; point the laser
pointers towards the front wall so that nobody is facing the beam; do
not shine at mirrored surfaces; ensure everybody is sitting down before
shining it so that nobody moves into its path. +

In case of accident contact first aider.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
