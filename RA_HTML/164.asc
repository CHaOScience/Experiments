Useful information

Kit List: 

*NB: this experiment does not have a box* +
Candle (Tea light) +
Matches +
Deep walled heat-proof container (e.g. ceramic mug) +
Plastic beaker +
Bicarbonate of soda +
Vinegar +
Cloth (useful to be able to wipe-up spillages)

Packing Away: 

The liquid vinegar/bicarb reaction products may be poured down a
drain/sink.

Frequency of use: 

3

Explanation

Explanation: 

Setup note +
This experiment will only work in very still conditions (somewhere not
too draughty indoors) since if there is any wind the carbon dioxide will
blow away rather than extinguishing the flame.

Experiment +
Light a tea light (small candle in a metal holder). +
Mix vinegar and bicarb in a film cannister. +
Carefully, without spilling any of the liquid, pour the carbon dioxide
over the candle. The flame should go out.

Explanation (NB, some kids will have seen the mini explosions experiment
and so will have more idea what's going on than others)

Light the tealight. +
- Discuss burning. What is needed for something to burn? Fire triangle-
fuel, heat, oxygen. +
How can we put out a fire? +
(Kids may talk about fire extinguishers... if they do, can draw that
into how different extinguishers work- CO~2~, water, powder.) +
Take away the fuel (like turning off a gas flame on a hob). +
Take away the heat (cool things down, part of how water puts out
fires... takes energy to heat the water so less is available to carry on
the fire). +
Take away oxygen (smothering the flame, what we're going to do here).

We're going to try putting out a fire by depriving it of oxygen using a
gas called carbon dioxide which is heavier than air, and in which flames
can't burn (used in fire extinguishers). +
Make carbon dioxide by reacting vinegar (like on chips) with sodium
bicarbonate/bicarbonate of soda/bicarb which they may have used for
cooking. Discuss where the CO~2~ comes from (locked up in carbonate in
solid, let out by vinegar or lemon juice (acids), or by heating as in
cake baking). Reaction is: Acid + Carbonate -> Salt + Water + Carbon
Dioxide

Pour CO2 over the flame... it should go out (will work better if candle
has burnt down a bit in the holder, as it will hold some CO2). If it
doesn't try again, you could discuss the effect of draughts on mixing
oxygen back into the carbon dioxide.

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Vinegar and bicarb mixed and CO2 produced and used to put
out a candle (tealight).

|RISKS |1. Fire risk +
2. Risk of burns +
3. Vinegar could get into eyes +
* Irritant to eyes +
* Irritant in cuts

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Use a tealight rather than a
more standard candle: short, stable candle contained within metal
holder. Make sure tealight is on a ceramic plate or something that will
not burn. +
Do not leave lit candle unattended. +
Keep tight control of matches. +
Ensure no flammable materials are near the lighted candle. +
Know where the nearest fire extiguisher is. +
2. Don't let kids get hold of candle. +
3. We have eyewash in the first aid box. The demonstrator must know
where the eyewash is located.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. In case of fire
follow local procedure. +
2. In case of burn run affected area under cold water for at least ten
minutes +
3. Call first aider in case of injury +
Call first aider. Use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and
confident to do so
