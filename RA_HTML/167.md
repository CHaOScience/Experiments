Risk Assessment
Risk Assessment: 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Watching coloured ice melt and sink through castor oil.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>1) Children may try to eat ice cubes (choking hazard) or drink water/oil.<br />
2) Water from experiment may come into contact with electrical parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>1) Explain to children that they must not eat/drink anything used in any experiment.<br />
Watch small children, and don't let them handle the ice.<br />
2) Set up experiment away from experiments using electrical parts. If any electrical parts are nearby, place them above the cylinder filled with water.</td>
