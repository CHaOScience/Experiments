Useful information

Kit List: 

Paper, paperclips, scissors - sycamore seeds +
Many different types of seeds +
Fan and paper punchings +
Gloves and velcro balls +
Small fruit and rocky road (fake poo) +
Half pipe, bucket of water, small ball +
Catapult and small bean bags

Explanation

Explanation: 

While you wait activity; design/make a sycamore seed (or several) cut
out paper template, make adjustments, attach paper clip or two (ready
for throwing later during the talk - showing how seed shape affects
dispersion)

But there isn’t one universal seed shape [many pictures and props]
different seeds have different adaptations for the various environments
that the plants inhabit [more pictures]

And there are two important jobs/features of seeds; +
Dispersal mechanisms - just dropping the seeds at the base of the tree
would be no good! (potentially have a volunteer keep on dropping the
seeds (probably a bean bag so that it doesn’t roll away and spoil the
demo!) - start off just dropping, ask where the plant will grow +
Wind - dandelion, orchids (use a fan, or a large model that we can
blow) +
Animal - burdock, fruit (normal and large fruits and megafauna) (get the
velcro balls from last year and fluffy socks and have two volunteers
brush past each other) then eat some fruit, walk off and drop some fake
poo (syrupy rocky road with lots of seed in it) mini quiz, ‘typical’ of
animal to fruit +
Water - coconut (have a section of half pipe to float it down into a
bucket) +
Catapult - broom (make a coiled catapult which fires with elastic
uncoiling and the video of it happening in real life) +
protection/durability Not always the best conditions when the seed first
lands somewhere, sometimes need to wait, but need to survive the
waiting… +
Seed coatings; surviving digestion, water (have some uncoated & swollen
and coated & unswollen seed?), squashing, fire +
Detecting the right conditions; light, water, smoke (not sure how any of
these would work out though)

Risk Assessment: 

*Experiment*

*Seed design*

*Examples of seeds*

*None dispersal*

*Wind dispersal*

*Animal dispersal pt1*

*Animal dispersal pt2*

*Projectile dispersal*

*Water dispersal*

*Description*

Children cut out sycamore seed template under parental supervision, then
add a paper clip, ready to throw the seed later in the talk

Examples of different seeds placed under the visualizer, potential to
handle at end of talk

Volunteer or presenter drops bean bag onto floor

Using a fan to blow small paper circles ("seeds") across the front of
the lecture room

Picking up velcro balls and moving them across the lecture room

Eating fruit then dropping fake poo on the other side of the lecture
room

Catapulting a bean bag across the front of the lecture room

Volunteer floats a ball down a half pipe into a bucket

*Hazard*

scissors

thrown objects

Choke and trip hazard

Trip hazard

Small bits of paper on floor could be slippery

Scratching from velcro

Choking as eat fruit

Slipping on fake poo

Flying bean bag

Spilling water, slip and electrical hazard

*Risks to audience*

Cuts from scissors and paper cuts

Getting hit by the paper seeds when thrown

Child eating a seed at the end and choking

None

Could slip while leaving lecture room

Scratched by velcro

Slipping whilst leaving lecture room

Hit by bean bag

Volunteer getting wet and cold

Slip hazard when leaving lecture room

*Risks to presenter*

Getting hit by paper seeds

Slipping on paper seeds

Slipping on seeds if they fall on the floor

Tripping on bean bag whilst finishing lecture

Could slip while finishing lecture

Scratched by velcro

Choking on fruit when eaten

Slipping on dropped ‘poo’ whilst finishing the talk

Hit by beanbag

Getting wet and cold

Slip hazard when finishing lecture

*Control measures*

Require parental supervision

Ask parents to use the scissors on behalf of small children and remind
everyone to be careful with them

Have a designated drop point for seeds

Warn children not to throw the seeds at anyone, particularly avoiding
faces

Keep seeds in lidded containers until they are used

Supervise seed handling, making sure that they don't get put in mouths

Pick up bean bag and tidy away immediately after demo

Ensure paper blown into corner away from exit route. Lay out large sheet
under area blowing paper to speed up tidying up and avoid paper
everywhere

Ensure gloves are used to brush past the velcro

Eat a small fruit or pretend to eat it

Drop ‘poo’ onto plastic so that it can easily be tidied away after the
demonstration

Fire catapault across front of lecture room, away from audience, other
presenter and door

Use light bean bag

Presenters hold the pipe of water at the right height for the volunteer
to easily reach it

Carry out demo away from front desk and electrical cabling

Have a large bucket to catch water in and supply of paper towels to mop
up potential spillages
