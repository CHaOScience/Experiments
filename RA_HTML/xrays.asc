Useful information

Kit List: 

X-ray light box. +
Collection of X-rays and MRIs. +
Kettle lead with 'right-angled' end that fits.

Packing Away: 

The radiographs live in an envelope in the back of light box. +
The kettle lead has a tendency to go missing, it should be stored in one
of the medic boxes (e.g. the Boris box where it doesn't take up too much
space).

Explanation

Explanation:

of X-rays in use] +
- General - What is it? Do they know when are they taken (when someone
might have a fracture) and where? Asking whether they know anyone who's
had one or had a plaster cast can be a good way to get their
attention/persuade them that you are not a child-eating ogre.

How do x-rays work? you can talk about the production of X rays to older
kids - it involves very high voltages across metal releasing photons
which travel along and get stopped by things which are dense and/or
which have high molecular mass (this is why calcium shows up, and
explains blood being somewhat radioopaque because of its iron content -
you can see blood in the heart, and you can also visualise it on CT
scans, which are just X rays taken at loads of different levels and
cunningly put together).

Smaller kids will appreciate something a bit like light which can go
through softer things eg. skin but not harder things eg bone, metal
implants. Of course then explaining a barium enema can be tricky, but
you could describe it as "special liquid which can be seen on X rays".

- Ask lots of questions, get them to work out what everything is for
themselves (our skeleton can help with this). If they're young it will
probably take them half an hour to work out what they're looking at.

- Legs - which way up? Broken bones - Why do the kids think we take
different views?-, kneecap, hip joint, bone growth can be discussed if
they look clever, with the views we have of immature bones, which are
still cartilagenous at the epiphyseal growth plates.

- Chest - heart, lungs, diaphragm, collarbone, ribs

- Putting stuff into body to see on x-rays -intestines, arteriograms
(not everything in your body is a vein…), why have arteries

- Skull-compare with skeleton, what you can see, eyes, nose, mouth,
teeth, sinuses

- pathological X-rays are great, especially to talk about hip
replacements and whatever fun pathologies there are!

Basically, you can go through the x-rays however you like and develop
your own spiel, but as it's one of my favourites I thought I'd write
down roughly what I do!

-Start with talking about why you might have an x-ray. +
-Ask them how x-rays are made. I talk about a 'special kind of light'
(if they're older, you can start talking about the electromagnetic
spectrum, especially if they've had a look at our UV and IR experiments)
that can go through soft bits of the body but not hard bits like bone. +
I get them to tell me what they would see behind me if I stood with a
big light in front of me and a wall behind (my shadow). So then what
would you see if they shone x-rays at me instead (a shadow of just my
bones - you can talk about x-ray film here too if you like). +
-What are bones for? (support, locomotion, protection - see Skeleton
explanation) +
-Skull x-ray - why do we have big spaces in our skull? (decrease
weight) +
- why do some of the teeth look different? (fillings - can talk about
x-rays not passing through metal) +
-Chest x-ray - identify the bones (ribs, clavicles, spine) +
- identify the organs (big spaces are air-filled lungs, the thing in the
middle is the heart - they're always amazed by how low and central it
is) +
- but I said x-rays go through soft bits? What is the heart made of? How
can we see it on the x-ray? Actually, x-rays can't go through metal. Do
bones have metal in them? (calcium - they usually know this or will get
it with prompts about why you should drink milk to keep your bones
strong) What is the heart full of? (blood) Does blood have metal in it
then? (iron - they may not know this. If you like you can then talk
about iron and haemoglobin and red blood cells - there are lots of
tangents to go off in on this experiment, depending on what they're
interested in!) +
-Hand and foot x-rays - did they know they have so many bones in their
foot? Compare their hands to Boris if he's nearby. +
-Arm angiogram - two things you can do with this: talk about the
angiogram and contrast medium etc. If doing this, compare with the
barium enema. Alternatively, this radiograph is clearly of a young child
- large spaces between metacarpals/phalanges, few carpals visible. Can
compare to adult hand x-ray and talk about calcification, can even
relate to foetal skull, especially if the model is within reach. There
is a radiograph of the pelvis which is also of a child, the growth
plates in the femur are clearly visible so you can compare them and talk
about how space between the bones is needed for growth and you can judge
the age/developmental level of a child from an x-ray. +
-Pelvis - see above for growth plates. Yes, it is male (always gets some
giggles if they spot the shadows!) +
-Double contrast barium enema - I usually describe this as a late stage
barium meal - cheating I know, but no-one's picked me up on it yet!
Compare with the angiogram and talk about how we can use contrast media
to see things otherwise not visible on x-rays. +
-Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreaticogram (ERCP) - at least I
think that's what it is. To be honest I usually hide it. If you are
capable of explaining it in a manner comprehensible to small children,
please let me know and update this explanation! +
-Humerus with screws - get them to work out what the screws are, talk
about how some breaks are so bad/misaligned that pins and screws are
needed to realign the bones.

MRI images +
-First point - these images were donated by a committee member, so they
are not anonymised as all the radiographs (which are teaching images)
are. This is fine - you just might need to know as we have in the past
had members of the public tell us off for using identifiable images, but
it's ok as we do have full permission! +
-I usually only go on to these with older/interested kids. +
-Start by asking if the images look different to the radiographs. Ask if
they've heard of MRI scans/seen people on TV going into those big
scanning machines. Get them to work out what part of the body you're
looking at, and that it's like you've sliced across the spine in two
different directions. Point out that you can see soft tissues. Talk
about why this might be more useful than an x-ray (you can see more than
just the bone in fine detail!) +
-My explanation of MRI is a bit rough: the machine contains an extremely
strong magnet. This makes all the water molecules in your body line up
in the same direction like lots of little magnets (they may have played
with compasses in magnetic fields at school). The machine then fires
radio waves at the body. This knocks all the little spinning water
molecules slightly out of line, but a different amount out of line
depending on the environment of the molecule (i.e. where it is). When
the radio wave is turned off, the molecules all flick back to where they
were in the magnetic field, releasing energy. This energy release is
captured by sensors and turned into an image.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Looking at x-rays

|RISKS a|

Flicker from the fluorescent tube in the light box has the potential to
induce seizures in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy - this is
very unlikely but has happened once!

Discourage people from staring too closely at the light box for
prolonged periods, if they complain of feeling unwell switch the box off
and advise them not to look at it further.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
Switch off the power to the light box

Call first aider in case of injury

|=======================================================================

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
