Explanation

Explanation: 

A smoking (recently blown-out) match is dropped into a lemonade bottle
containing a little water. The bottle is closed and then squeezed, held
for a few moments, and released. Water condenses on the nucleation
points provided by the smoke as the air pressure drops and temperature
falls slightly.
