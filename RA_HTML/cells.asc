Introduction

Using a model of a cell and various slides to explain what a cell is,
about how different cells are specialized for their function, and how
bacterial cells are different.

Useful information

Kit List: 

Microscope (not dissecting), slides with cell spreads, fabric model of
animal cell.

Explanation

Explanation: 

Ideas to explain... +
----------

Younger children

- Introduce to the idea of a cell by using model, and looking at cells
down the microscope +
- Use the model to explain what's inside a cell (nucleus is the 'control
centre', mitochondria 'make' energy) +
- Cells are very small (typically 10 um for an animal cell... that's
1000 times smaller than 1 cm (you can use the ruler to show 1 cm) +
- Not all cells are the same - you can look at red blood cells (the
reason why blood looks red when you cut yourself!), and the columnar
epithelium slide has lots of different shaped cells visible. +
- Bacteria are also cells, but they are smaller and don't have a nucleus
(associate bacteria with disease e.g. food poisoning caused by E. coli).
Bacteria can be lots of different shapes (look at E. coli,
Staphylococcus, Spirillum).

----------

Older children

(in addition to the above) +
- Other internal components of cells e.g. DNA in the nucleus (can relate
to kiwi fruit experiment if they've already done this), ribosomes,
endoplasmic reticulum, golgi and what they do +
- Plant cells - cell walls and chloroplasts (we have a root tip squash
slide where the cell walls are visible and the nuclei are nicely
stained, but they don't have chloroplasts because it's a root so it
doesn't need to photosynthesise! If they want to see more plant cells,
there's a whole demo on plants...) +
- Specialization - red blood cells, nerve cells, epithelium in
intestine, liver cells, muscle cells etc (see below for photos of our
slides) +
- Fungi - also eukaryotic cells - yeast are unicellular. Penicillium
grows as mycelium. (See below) +
- Cell division - chromosome spread, mitosis (see below)

-----------------------------------------------------

Possibly useful background information and ideas on how to explain
things: +
----------

What are cells?

- Cells are analogous to a building brick - houses are built of lots of
bricks, like people are built of lots of cells (50-75 trillion!) +
- Cells aren't just bricks - they are alive, and make things, use
things, and process information +
- They do that because inside their fatty outer membrane, they contain
lots of other things +
- The nucleus is the 'control centre' of the cell +
- It contains lots of instructions on how to make things called
proteins, from which the rest of the cell is made +
- The instructions are written in a 4-letter code on very long molecules
called DNA (see Kiwi DNA experiment) +
- You can see DNA in the nucleus in the model +
- Cells need to make the proteins using instructions from the DNA in the
nucleus +
- A copy of the instructions for a single protein are made (RNA) and
transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm +
- Ribosomes 'translate' the language of RNA into the language of protein
(ribosomes = buttons on model) +
- Proteins that are going to be exported by the cell pass into the ER
(endoplasmic reticulum) (ER = very folded bit near nucleus on model!) +
- Proteins then move to the Golgi apparatus (other side of nucleus on
model) and then on to the cell membrane +
- Cells need energy - this is supplied by mitochondria (they convert
energy from sugars into ATP, the energy currency of the cell) +
----------

Looking at slides

- Show scale using ruler (eukaryotic (animal/plant/fungal) cell is
roughly 10 um in length, bacteria are often smaller than 1 um) +
- The nuclei are stained in many of our cells +
- We have a variety of different cell types - you can discuss why the
cells have particular shapes or features (some background info in the
pictures below) +
- Cell division - look at chromosome spreads, and slides of dividing
cells (by mitosis). Look for different stages of division.

This is just some background info and ideas about what you might want to
say; you probably don't want to go through all of this with one set of
children (unless they are super-keen and know some of it already!), but
choose things to look at guided by what you and they are interested in!

Risk Assessment: 

DESCRIPTION: +
Looking at a range of pre-made slides down a microscope +
Looking at a fabric model of a cell

RISKS +
1)Electrical hazard (microscope), especially near sources of water. +
2)Using thin glass slide could result in broken glass with risk of
cuts +
3)The light fitting under the microscope becomes hot, and could cause
burns +
4)Injury from swallowing parts of fabric model cell e.g. buttons +
5)Grazing from velcro on fabric model cell

CONTROL MEASURES +
1a)See separate electrical parts risk assessment +
1b)Keep microscope away from water as it is not required for this
experiment +
2)If slides are broken, carefully collect/sweep up broken pieces, wrap
in paper and dispose of carefully. +
3)Warn children to be careful, turn of lamp when not in use, if it's
getting hot put a cardboard shield around (but not touching) the lamp to
prevent accidental contact. +
4)Ensure small parts of model are securely attached (e.g. buttons
stitched on) +
5)Ensure children handle model carefully under supervision

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY +
In case of accident, call first aider. Run burns under cold water for at
least 10 minutes.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
