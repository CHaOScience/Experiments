[[overview]]
Overview
^^^^^^^^

By using a spinning chair, weird effects due to conservation of angular
momentum can be felt. Have a go before demonstrating, but beware - it's
difficult to concentrate when your head is spinning!

[[set-up]]
Set up: +
^^^^^^^^^

Try to make sure the chair is level, there is more than a metre of clear
space around it in all directions, and the floor is something that won't
graze anyone who lands on it (e.g. carpet).

Find somewhere convenient to keep the bits of kit so that people don't
trip over them.

[[what-can-you-do-with-it]]
What can you do with it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Masses:* +

* By holding the masses at different distances from the body, the speed
of spinning changes. For small children, it's enough to get them to just
stick their arms and legs out.

*Wheels:* +

* Before sitting on the spinny chair, hold the bicycle wheel between two
hands and spin it. Turn your arms so that the wheel is horizontal. There
is a pull in the opposite direction.
* Stopping the wheel while it's spinning. For a child standing, stop the
wheel so that they feel a twist in their feet. For a child on the chair,
if they are stationary, start the wheel spinning then stop it. They will
start to spin.
* Turning the wheel over while sitting on the spinny chair (initially
stationary) so they move in one direction then the other.
* Demonstrating the precession of a wheel while hanging from a string
due to the moment caused by gravity.

[[other-things-to-talk-about]]
Other things to talk about
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Artificial satellites use gyroscopes to orient themselves without
wasting reaction mass. +
Stable rotation axes - important for satellites. +
 +
Gyros are used in ships for navigation, by pointing to True North (not
Magnetic North) as determined by the rotation of the Earth, which is
more useful for navigation. Also, magnetic compasses can be affected by
the steel in ship hulls, whereas gyrocompasses are immune to this
effect. +
 +
Spinning in trampolining or ice-skating: to go faster, trampolinists and
ice-skaters bring their arms and/or legs in. +

[[a-very-brief-explanation]]
A very brief explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change of rotation speed: Explaining angular momentum can be very
difficult as it's very unintuitive (the entire reason this experiment is
fun, that and the spinning) but there are some simple approximations you
can make by just assuming children are point masses in a vacuum, but
don't tell them that. +
 +
 +
If you ignore the mass of the children, but not of the bags of rice,
then by conservation of angular momentum you would expect the rice bags
to move with constant velocity (for a point mass m at distance from axis
r and angular speed w, velocity v = rw and angular momentum L= mr^2^w is
conserved, therefore v is conserved). You can show them, by spinning
around on foot with the masses in your hands, one arm outstretched the
other bent, that the mass on the outside is moving further in the same
amount of time, thus must be going faster. Alternatively use the
streamer sticks to show that air is passing the sticks faster when held
out at arm's length compared to close in. +
 +
 +
But we know that masses should not change speed (can explain via some
rudimentary newtons first law, rather than angular momentum), therefore
the only way to conserve linear speed is to change angular speed, and
speed up or slow down the chair. +
 +
 +
If they understand this you can then explain that human beings, much
like rice bags, do also have some mass and therefore some effect, and
for the really keen ones, there are nice discussions about the limits of
the speeds if they were massless, if the masses were at an infinite
distance, or at a distance approaching 0. +
 +

[[tips-for-demonstrating]]
Tips for Demonstrating: +
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is some potential for slipping off the chair and landing badly.
Get people to sit well back on the chair - that way they have good
contact with the seat, and they can easily adjust their centre of
gyration by leaning forwards. Small children need to be lifted onto the
chair.

Some of the more spindly kids can build up an impressive amount of spin
as they pull their arms and legs in, heavier kids will tend to slide off
the chair, while with adults there is a risk of toppling the chair. Use
only moderate speeds. Alternatively, always start the kids with their
arms and legs / weights close in to them. You can then start them
spinning and all that can happen when they move is their angular
velocity decreases.

Some kids like to experiment with how dizzy they can make themselves -
best to stop this before it gets out of hand with a lecture on how the
semi-circular canals in the inner ear detect rotation, and why they are
getting dizzy. Slosh the water in the plastic bottle to show how the
fluid in the inner ear moves around.

The wheels are heavy, and when spinning move in unexpected ways. This
has lead to a couple of minor abrasions where the rim has rubbed against
the bare arms of the person holding it. Test the child's ability to hold
the weight of the wheel before starting it spinning - remember that they
will also need to hold it up for a while, and have some spare strength
to resist its gyration.

The kids will almost always notice the spinny chair, or have seen people
on it earlier, but it’s often best to talk about what you’re going to do
first before anyone gets too dizzy.

[[basic-procedure-and-explanation]]
Basic Procedure and Explanation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"Who wants a go on my spinny chair?"

[[in-depth-explanation]]
In Depth Explanation: +
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Talk about pushing something to make it move, and what determines how
hard you need to push. +
Give them the masses and set them spinning with a gentle push on the
arm. Two masses, one in each hand, arms out sideways is most effective
(add legs up forwards too, if the child is heavy) +
For smaller children, you don’t often need the masses: they will be able
to feel themselves speeding up and slowing down. However, the masses do
make it more obvious for the people watching. +
Get them to experiment with bringing the masses in to their bodies and
away again (concentrating and distributing their mass). Miming the
actions as you say them helps communication here. +
Stop them spinning then ask first what happens when the masses are in
different places, then ask why it happens.

Get them to observe the paths the masses are moving along (repeat
experiment if necessary). The idea is: it is a +
shorter distance around a small circle than a large one, while the
masses want to keep the same speed, so get +
around the smaller circle quicker.

Hold one weight close in to your body and one far away whilst you are
sat on the chair. Ask which is going fastest. Kids are often quite bad
at this so get them to work out which goes furthest, , then propose a
race around a circle, where one person is close to the centre and the
other is further away. Who has to go fastest if you get around in the
same time? Now think about the weights, as they come in they are going
'too fast' for the distance out that they are so they get ahead of your
spin. This drags you forwards until you're going a bit faster. As you
allow them to go further out they're going too slowly for how far out
they are, so they drag behind and slow you down.

Momentum can be difficult to explain, especially with younger children,
although it can sometimes be done. Often talking about loaded shopping
trolleys is a good way to start: once you get them moving, they will
carry on going until they are stopped. Amount of spin, or spinniness
helps in the explanation of the spinny chair, then angular momentum can
be introduced as “what scientists call it”.

To give them a feeling for how moment of inertia varies with mass
distribution you can get on the chair yourself +
with the two large masses, and get them to spin you slowly, first with
concentrated mass, then distributed. +
What happens to all the extra effort they put in to spin you in
distributed configuration when you make yourself +
concentrated? (True - the extra angular momentum they supplied is
conserved, and you did start with more energy, +
but you do work too when you pull the masses in) (Warning: it can be
hard to demonstrate when your head is +
spinning...)

[[using-the-wheel-on-the-chair]]
Using the wheel on the chair: +
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spin the wheel slowly on one side, ask which way it is spinning, turn it
over. Which way is it spinning now? We can change the way the wheel is
spinning just by turning it over. It is often worth giving the wheel to
a couple of the kids before putting anyone on the chair, even if it’s
just so they can see how funny it feels- ask them how their feet feel.
Make sure you have explained what you’re doing and be careful they don’t
scrape the spinning wheel against themselves.

Get them on the chair, spin up the wheel and get them to hold it
up-right, one hand on each side. Stand back and let them experiment with
turning the wheel (slowly!) onto one side and then the other. Sometimes
they don’t know which way to turn the wheel, so maybe show them what you
mean before-hand. Observe directions of rotation, and if you think they
will follow, talk through the conservation of angular momentum about the
vertical axis (transfer to the earth!).

You can also do the same thing just by starting the wheel spinning and
getting them to stop it, and then feeling the force acting on them.

[[section]]

[[using-the-string]]
Using the string
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suspend the wheel from the string, hold it with the axis level and ask
what will happen if you leave go. They should say that it falls down,
but they'll expect you to be asking because it doesn't, so you may
surprise them when it does. Now get it spinning and do the same thing
again, the wheel stays up (as long as it's spinning fast enough). Ask
why and see where they get. With more confident kids, talking about what
made it fall over before and what that force is doing now is often a
good way to start: it keeps the idea of something pushing it around. +
Remind them that earlier the wheel when turned could start them
spinning, and ask what it can start spinning now. If there's nowhere to
put your spin you can't lose it.

Additional Background (If you read the above then you're good to go on
demonstration, read the below if you have more time. Don't expect to get
anywhere near precession with normal kids though, and don't go further
than you know confidently, kids can smell fear): +
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Angular momentum is an odd concept. The conservation of angular momentum
can be derived from the symmetry of the +
laws of physics with respect to rotations of the reference frame (c.f.
classical mechanics). Or you can ignore +
it and stick to point masses with negligible structure (or things that
are built up by summing or integrating +
over such masses). That way the symmetry will seep into your
calculations through the geometry, and you will +
still automatically conserve angular momentum.

It is only when you begin to leave out large chunks of a problem's
geometry (treat an extended body as a 'thing' +
rather than the sum of its parts) that you need to make angular momentum
explicit in a calculation. Looking at +
it more positively, angular momentum is the only aspect of the dynamics
of the extended body that you need to +
retain - so you can discard a lot of irrelevant detail at the start of a
calculation rather than waiting for it +
to cancel out at the end.)

It is the tendency of people's intuition to leave out geometry (to apply
their experience of large non-rotating +
objects to the wheel), but not replace it with a-m that makes this seem
so weird.

My normal approach to the spinny chair is to begin by working in terms
of point masses, showing how this gives +
rise to angular momentum (although I shy away from the technical term,
and just call it spin) - trying to get people +
to add these ideas to their intuition. Then if they stick it out all the
way through to the precessing gyroscope, +
I try and pick that apart in terms of point masses and centripetal
forces.

For the 'ice-skater' experiment, to bring the weights onto a smaller
circle in the lab frame, you have to give them some radial velocity +
in addition to the tangential velocity they already have. You don't get
to take this velocity away again +
when the weights reach the desired radius. To see this, consider
applying the delta v as a single inward radial +
impulse, then turn off the centripetal force until the desired radius is
reached. The minimum impulse that +
can be applied to achieve a given radius will make the mass's velocity
tangent to a circle of that radius, so +
that when the minimum radius is reached there is no radial velocity to
reclaim.

In the original rotating frame, the particle begins by moving radially
inward, but gets increasingly ahead of the +
rotating frame (in the lab frame it is taking a short-cut across a chord
of the circle), so its path curves in the +
direction of rotation. This is the fictitious Coriolis force.

To move to a larger radius, first turn off the centripetal force, then
apply the impulse once the new radius is +
reached. This time the angle between the radial impulse and the
particle's velocity is obtuse, so we can extract +
energy from the particle. This is not straightforward to explain to
children. You might be able to say something +
about how, when the masses are spiralling inward, the inward pull is no
longer purely sideways to their paths. +
Also, they might accept the conservation of energy argument as they will
have really been able to feel the work +
they do to pull the masses in. This could be confusing though as in the
person's instantaneous rest frame, radius +
acts like height for potential energy.

[image2]

[[the-angular-momentum-version]]
The Angular Momentum Version: +
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A-M is not constant, but its magnitude remains the same because the
plane of the couple is always at right-angles to the current plane of
rotation (because the . Say the wheel is spinning in the x-z plane,
while the couple is in the y-z plane - the wheel precesses so that it is
spinning in the y-z plane (you can only spin around one axis at a time).
But the couple is still 90 degrees ahead... (or use axial vectors if you
prefer.)

[[my-gyroscope-explanation]]
My Gyroscope Explanation +
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standing on the ground, let them hold the wheel with one hand on each
handle.

(Be consistent in which way you spin the wheel for this part of the
experiment - it is harder to get lost +
in your explanation if you always do it the same way). Twist opposite
handles of the wheel up and down, +
feeling the pushes and pulls on the handles (in and out in alternate
arms). Hold the handles level, and +
rotate whole body from side to side (i.e. twisting the wheel sideways
without bashing it against arms), again +
feeling the forces (up and down in opposite hands).

Get their observations and help them summarise them while you thread the
string through the end of one of +
the handles. With the wheel not spinning, hold the string in one hand
and keep the handles level with the other, +
get them to predict, then release so that you are only holding the
string. Describe this motion as a twist. Try for +
predictions of what will happen when we try the same thing with a
spinning wheel, then demonstrate it. Once released, +
push the handle without string around in the direction of precession a
little so that the wheel sits up and looks +
even weirder.

The key to picking apart what is happening here is to realise that
things can only spin round in one lot of circles +
at a time, if you try make it something spin two ways at once its
component particles are doing something much more +
complicated.

Talk about how things move in straight lines unless they are being
pulled sideways. Go back to shopping trollies, +
conkers on strings, (drop blue-tac onto the rim and show how it flies
off?).

Discuss how when wheel is rotating only one way, forces are all towards
the middle, and all balance out, +
so are not felt in the handles. Twirling a conker, forces don't balance.
With the handles level, and the wheel +
spinning top towards you while precessing around anti-clockwise (when
looked down on), think about the motion of +
its consitiuent particles, and the forces required to generate that
motion (and thus supplied by the hands). The +
bit of the wheel that is at the top would just come towards you, but as
you are forcing the wheel to precess round, +
you are making it curve sideways to your right. Likewise the bottom of
the wheel needs a sideways force in the other +
direction to make it curve to your left. These forces are opposite, but
don't line up, so they are a twist. You can +
feel your hands supplying this push as you force the wheel to precess,
or you can hold the handles only at one end +
and balance out the twist this generates with the precession force.

(This seems to add up correctly to a linear dependance of the force on
the angular velocity of the wheel: as it goes +
faster, the curves become straighter, but the mass flows around them
faster, /and/ at a greater rate.) If drawing a +
diagram of this, follow the path of the top of the wheel for a few more
revolutions - projected on the horizontal +
plane this will be a complicated epicyclic curve (see glowstick photo) -
it is all the sideways curving that is generating the odd forces.

[[nutation]]
Nutation: +
^^^^^^^^^^^

The more I think about nutation, the less sure I am that I understand
it. This link shows you how complicated you can make it. At some point I
intend to try and translate some of that into english... (Anyone with
brain-cells to burn is welcome to try and beat me to it.)

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Kids spin round sitting on a rotating chair holding bags
of rice of different sizes at different distances. They can also use a
rotating bicycle wheel as a gyroscope, both on and off the chair. +

|RISKS a|
1.  Falling off chair
2.  Instability of chair
3.  Hitting someone while spinning
4.  Heavy chair and bags of rice, can be dangerous in transport
5.  Rotating bicycle wheel could hurt fingers.
6.  Chair may be incorrectly assembled, causing it to be unstable.
7.  Bicycle wheel is fairly heavy, and could damage things/people if
dropped.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1.  Demonstrator must maintain control of the chair and should not allow
it to spin at speeds at which there is a significant risk of the child
falling off. Make sure that the chair is placed on a flat floor, or
grass which is sufficiently flat to ensure stability, with no corners or
edges to fall against. If there is an area of flat grass or carpeted or
wooden floor, this should ideally be used. Avoid placing the weights,
and other hard objects on the floor haphazardly near the chair, which
could injure children if they fall off.
2.  Stop kids getting too violent - do not allow them to spin too fast.
Ensure chair is on flat ground. Tell children to step off if it is
spinning too fast. Stop the chair if it gets out of control. Make sure
other children stand away from the chair whilst it is spinning. Use
chair with stable base.
3.  Keep viewers back. Encourage people not to spin too fast.
4.  The person carrying the equipment should be strong enough to do so,
or get someone to help carry it.
5.  Bicycle wheel is covered in stiff plastic to stop fingers being
inserted between spokes. Be ready to help child with rotating wheel if
it gets out of control.
6.  Demonstrator to ensure the chair is correctly assembled (all parts
are labelled).
7.  Demonstrator should assess the size/strength of a child before
getting them to hold the gyroscope. If the child cannot hold it
comfortably in both hands, with arms horizontal and the wheel easily not
touching them then they are too small and/or weak (remember they will
have to hold it for a while, and not drop it when it feels like it's
fighting them). The demonstrator ought to be ready to take the wheel
back if required, and take some time to practice and get a feel for how
it moves before demonstrating it to the public (it's not hard to do, but
it's difficult to think of why people might drop it if you've not had a
play yourself). +
Ensure that people (particularly smaller children) don't have the string
around their wrist whilst holding the wheel so that it doesn't
sprain/damage the wrist if dropped. +
Another dropping risk comes from dangling it on the end of a piece of
string. This is a good bit of the demo to do, but make sure that the
string is both well tied, and not frayed, before doing this.
