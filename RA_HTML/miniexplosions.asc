Useful information

Kit List: 

Lemon Juice (and maybe vinegar) +
Bicarb +
A couple of washing up bowls +
Teaspoon or similar for scooping bicarb +
Clear plastic box with the hinged lid +
Green tray to catch any leakage from clear plastic box (doesn't live in
blue box) +
(All of this lives in a large blue box with white lid)

Frequency of use: 

5

Explanation

Explanation: 

*In a nutshell.....* +
Acid + Carbonate -> Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide +
Production of carbon dioxide in a sealed container to produce
explosions.

*How to set up the experiment* +
Initially, mix lemon juice (about 1/4 fill the cannister) and bicarb
(1/4 of a teaspoon) in the film cannister with the lid off, so that the
kids can see it frothing up. Ask them where they think the bubbles are
coming from/ what's in the bubbles (space for a bit of a discussion of
different gases here, many of them will have heard of CO2).

Get them to think about what lemon juice is like (sour), and what else
is sour (vinegar, other citrus juice..) and discuss that any acid can
let out the gas that's "trapped" in the powder. Possibly also discuss
use of bicarb in baking - heating it up releases gas, which puts bubbles
in your cakes.

The bubbles should froth well over the top of the cannister, point out
that if the lid were on the gas wouldn't be able to get out. Ask them to
predict what will happen if you put a lid on (does the gas have anywhere
else to go?)

Now try it and see if they're right! With older kids you can discuss how
molecules create pressure, ask them to push their hands against each
other a bit to demonstrate reaction forces.

Some children ask why there is no 'fire' if it is an explosion. It can
be worth explaining that an explosion is simply a rapid expansion of
gases and release of stored energy, often with heat being produced,
though this is not a necessary condition. Sealing the cannister causes
the pressure to build up, which stores energy, until the lid can no
longer resist the force of the trapped gases. The stored energy is then
released rapidly when the lid pops off and gases expand, causing the
explosion.

There are 2 slightly different approaches:

Method 1

Put some lemon juice in the cannister, put a piece of tissue paper over
the top of the cannister with bicarb on top of that, push the lid on so
it hold the tissue paper. The bicarb is now held at the top of the pot
away from the lemon juice. +
Put the cannister upside down in the clear plastic tank and shut the lid
(it's often a good idea to have the lid partially shut before you invert
the cannister to reduce the risk of it getting off you). The bicarb and
lemon juice will mix and the pot will explode upwards.

Method 2

Put some lemon juice in the cannister, press bicarb into the well in the
centre of the lid. The bicarb is now held at the top of the pot away
from the lemon juice. +
Put the cannister upside down in the clear plastic tank and shut the lid
(it's often a good idea to have the lid partially shut before you invert
the cannister to reduce the risk of it getting off you). The bicarb and
lemon juice will mix and the pot will explode upwards.

It's usually a good idea to try both methods and see which one works
better for you and the type of film cannister you happen to have.

*Some film cannisters explode better than others, so it is worth trying
different ones to make sure you are using the right lid. The oval ones
work really well.*

Other things to think about: vinegar (acetic acid) is a stronger acid
than lemon juice (citric acid); if using vinegar expect this reaction to
be quite quick...

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Lemon juice and bicarbonate mixed in a film cannister. Top
pressed on. Explodes off in box.

|RISKS a|
\1. Slip hazard +
2. Explosions could get out of box, (or occur before the cannister has
been put in the box) and get into eyes +
3. Eating the reaction

Irritant to eyes +
Irritant in cuts

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
\1. Clear up spills if on a slippery floor. Do experiment outside if
possible

\2. Do experiment in a clear lidded fish tank so kids are not peering
over the top to see what is happening, keep lid opening faced towards
demonstrator. +
Ensure the top of the tank is not at eye level (it is possible for a
small volume of the reagents to be propelled through the crack between
the top of the tank and the lid). Run a length of plastic tape along the
hinged side (which should be closest to your audience) to prevent
splattering.

\3. Do not let the kids do the reactions themselves or leave them alone
with the experiment.

It is important to keep the kids under control. Try to keep control over
at least one of the reagents, so the kids can't just do it themselves +
Don't let the kids peer over the top +
We have eyewash in the safety box- the demonstrator must ensure he or
she knows where it is but not adminster it unless they have been
trained. +
Tissue paper may be used as a "fuse" to increase the time taken for the
reactants to come into contact with each other - this gives more time to
get the cannister into the tank. Lemon juice is usually better than
vinegar, as it reacts more slowly, so again, there is more time to get
the canister into the tank. In addition, eye protection should be
provided for demonstrators to minimise possible risk of solution
splashing into demonstrator's eyes.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. Call first aider in
case of injury +
2. Call first aider. Use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and
confident to do so, if solution or reactants have entered eyes. +
3. Advise them that the reactants are all edible but to seek medical
attention if they start to feel very bad as experiment has been in
cupboard for unknown amount of time.
