Introduction

How the structure and composition of the Earth's interior can be
inferred without actually going there

Useful information

Kit List: 

Many rock samples (pumice, granite, basalt, peridotite, meteorites),
Planet models, Volcano model with vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, light
diffraction viewer, thin section microscope and camera, slinky, water
tank and rod, apple, bar magnet and compass, electromagnet, convection
tank with dye and heater

Packing Away: 

Return rock samples and thin section microscope and camera to the Earth
Sciences department +
Return any other equipment borrowed to the place of origin +
Keep the rest for possible usage in other experiments

Explanation

Explanation: 

The audience form the crew of the Earth-ship GSS Geologise that will
attempt to make a journey to the centre of the Earth. However, the
vessel doesn't seem to work, so we're going to have to use different
methods to work out what's going on beneath the surface of our planet
(using a model of the Earth, uncovering the various layers when they are
found). There also may be some music in the form of singing and playing
on a keyboard, and lights flashing to evoke the impression of the ship
working (or not as the case may be).

Rock Density:

The rocks at the surface of the Earth are much less dense than the
average density of the Earth, so the core must be made up of a more
dense material. Various rock samples will be used to illustrate this
(none handled by the audience):

- Pumice: I large sample of a very low density rock that can be thrown
up and headed (by the demonstrator) and can even float in water (use the
water tank) +
- Granite and Basalt: The constituents of the continental and oceanic
crusts that have a relatively low density +
- Peridotite: A rock from the mantle which is much more dense and
brought up by volcanoes (possible volcano demonstration with vinegar and
bicarbonate of soda and rolling of sleeve for ophiolites) +
- Meteorites: Various kinds of meteorites that have a much higher
density and imply that there is a dense core of iron (with an example of
small planetary body models colliding) with the rest being made up
mainly of silicates (talking about the Sun and how its composition can
be determined through light diffraction)

Along with the hand samples the thin section microscope with a camera
attached can show some of the minerals and forms in the different rock
types.

Seismic Waves:

Earthquakes produce seismic waves that pass through the Earth and can be
used to determine the structure of the planet. There are two kinds of
body waves produced by earthquakes: P Waves (Primary/Push longitudinal
waves) and S waves (Secondary/Sheer transverse waves). These two types
can be demonstrated by a slinky or by member of the audience in a line
holding onto the shoulders of the person in front, giving a gentle push
forward for the longitudinal wave and a gentle sway for the transverse
wave.

The seismic waves travel through the Earth and refract (shown by a rod
in the water tank) leading to different paths. The P and S waves have
shadow zones, implying that some of the core must be a liquid, with the
centre being solid due to crystallisation, high density and certain ray
paths.

The crust is found by certain waves travelling quicker on a higher
density layer below, but is very thin (use an apple to show the scale).

Magnetic Fields:

The Earth has a magnetic field that helps us find our way (show a
compass) and protects us from the solar wind (causing the Northern
Lights) is a bit like a bar magnet, but not exactly as the poles wander,
even switching over. The core is too hot to form a permanent magnet, so
rather it could be a convecting liquid of a conductive material, such as
the iron proposed before.

The water tank and a heater with some dye can be used to show a
convection current, whilst the electromagnet can be used as an analogy
of a self-exciting dynamo.

Possibly end with a song and the message that you don't always have to
go to places to find out what's going on there.
