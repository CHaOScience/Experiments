Useful information

Kit List: 

Eggs, a mixture of uncooked and hard boiled (you'll probably want more
hard boiled ones, as they tend to crack).

Packing Away: 

Dispose of eggs sensibly.

Explanation

Explanation: 

*Basic experiment* +
Spin an egg, either cooked or fresh. +
Stop the spin with one finger for a moment, then let go. +
The fresh egg will start spinning again because the inside of the egg
will carry on spinning when the outside stops and will cause the outside
to accelerate again. The cooked egg will stop dead. +
It's probably nicer to get people to try to think of ways to tell the
cooked and uncooked eggs apart before you show them how to do it! After
you have explained why the uncooked eggs carry on spinning get the kids
to spin a random egg and tell you whether they think it's cooked or
uncooked.

*Other stuff to talk about* +
You can also ask them what would happen if you filled an egg with syrup
and spun it and stopped it? Would it spin for a longer time or a shorter
time than an uncooked egg? It should spin for much less time than an
uncooked egg as it is very viscous and therefore the momentum diffuses
much faster through it (don't use words viscous, momentum or diffuses
though).

You could also try explaining why it's harder to spin an uncooked egg
then a cooked egg. I found it a bit complicated to explain but if you
talk about the fact that when you spin the egg initially only the egg
shell and the fluid very close within the egg (in the boundary layer of
the fluid) actually spins and then more and more of the fluid starts to
spin but this slows down the fluid that was originally spinning (this is
due to momentum diffusion with the fluid).

*If you're feeling brave...* +
Apparently if you spin a hard boiled egg fast enough on a very smooth
surface it will start tipping upwards and spinning around its axis of
symmetry rather than lying flat (not unlike those toys you can't knock
over I suppose). That is, at fast enough speed the stable orbit becomes
the upright one rather than the flat one. Not sure how easy this is to
make work in practice though...

Risk Assessment: 

Spinning and stopping fresh and cooked eggs

*Risks:* +
 +
1. If dropped on the floor eggs may smash, causing a slip hazard. +
 +
2. Some people are very allergic to (especially raw) egg. +
 +
3. Salmonella risk from raw eggs.

*Control Measures:* +
 +
1. Spin eggs in a shallow tray to reduce risk of dropping them. +
Have equipment available to clear up broken eggs +
 +
2. If an egg is broken ensure it is thoroughly cleared up, keep visitors
away from area until area has been cleaned. +
 +
3. Only perform this experiment with Lion Mark eggs (from chickens
vaccinated against salmonella). Wash hands after handling raw eggs and
ensure visitors do likewise.

*In case of accident:* +
 +
1. In case of injury call first aider +
 +
2. Anyone with a level of allergy which might cause a major issue should
be carrying appropriate drugs etc and they (or their carer) will know
what to do. Risk is no greater in this case than going into a
supermarket. +
 +
3. We won't know that someone has salmonella poisoning until well after
an event. We might wish to warn people of the salmonella risk in the
event of contact with a raw, non-Lion-marked egg, but really the risks
are substantially lower than those incurred in baking a cake.
