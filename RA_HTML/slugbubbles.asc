Does a tube of water drain more slowly with a bung in the top?

Useful information

Kit List: 

3 tubes of different diameters but similar lengths held vertically on a
board. +
A frame to which the board is bolted to keep it upright. +
A tray to catch water underneath the tubes (this is now a box with the
board mounting permanently affixed)

Plugs that fit the tubes (and thumbs for those tubes for whichyou are
missing plugs!) +
A small pile of straws. +
A bucket or two to hold replacement water. +
A jug for filling tubes. +
A couple of differently sized funnels for filling tubes.

Packing Away: 

Dry it as far as possible, pack into its box.

Frequency of use: 

1

Explanation

Explanation: 

This experiment uses perspex tubes which are clamped to a board, and can
be filled with water. When the bung at the bottom of a tube is pulled
out, it empties. If there is a bung in the top, it empties much more
slowly, as the air has to get in the bottom (a 'slug bubble').

*What to do.*

Put a bung in the bottom of a tube. +
Fill it up with water using funnel and jug. Kids really want to help
fill them up, and this is a good way of getting them involved. +
Ask what they think will happen when the bung is removed: does the water
rush out, drip out slowly, stay in etc.? +
Ask if they think it'll come out fast enough to get their shoes wet. +
Then ask if they're willing to test their hypothesis in reality, or take
a few steps back and remember where their shoes were at the time (I
normally look at the parents for confirmation of feet wetting next!) +
Count down and remove the plug. SPLASH :-) +
What happened? +
Water rushed out etc...

*Why?* +
Gravity pulled the water towards the ground and when the water came out
of the tube, and air replaced it from the top. (Notice the subtle hint
for the next stage.) +
Get it filled it up again, but this time put a bung in the top as
well. +
WARNING: Make sure you hold the bottom bung on when you put the top bung
in as water is not particularly compressible, and you can easily force
the bottom bung out by pushing the top one in. +
Now ask them what'll happen. +
Then demonstrate - you can ask one of them to remove it this time :-) +
Did they see the bubble go up the tube? Get them to try to explain what
was going on. My explanation is just that for water to come out of the
tube, air has to get in, as there can't be nothing in the tube (vacuum)
as the high air pressure around will not allow it. However, it did not
all stay in there because the hole at the bottom was nice and large
allowing air and water to swap. You can see the air going in - it goes
up the middle in the form of a big bubble, called a 'slug bubble'. The
water flows out down the sides.

Next we have a race... +
Fill up all the tubes, put bungs in both ends, and recruit some help to
get it started. (You will probably have to loosen off the bungs in the
bigger ones, as they are quite difficult to remove. +
Which one is going to empty fastest? Why? See what each spectator thinks
- often people have different views. They can be encouraged to argue it
both ways: perhaps the big tube will empty faster, as there is more
space at the bottom, perhaps it will empty more slowly, as there is mor
water to come out, or perhaps these effects will cancel out and they
will empty at the same speed.

Ready, steady, Go!

The biggest one empties fastest. Why did it do that? +
A smaller hole at the end means that there is even less space for the
water to swap over, so it comes out much slower. The more space there is
for the air and water to squeeze past one another, the faster it can
come out.

If you like, you can then move onto some straws, saying that straws are
exactly the same, but they have even smaller holes at the bottom. +
Straw under water, thumb on the top. Remove from water, remove thumb. A
straw has such a small hole that the surface tension of the water cannot
be broken.

*An interesting addition* +
[Stolen from the Independent (2/8/06)] +
Poke a hole in the side of a cup, cover the hole, fill with water,
uncover the hole: water comes out Repeat, only this time drop the cup at
the same time as uncovering the hole: water stays in, so you can talk
about gravity acting on water and the cup, and things falling at the
same speed etc. Probably not a tremendously exciting addition, but maybe
something to talk about with very interested people, or something...
[Plastic cups tend to shatter when dropped on concrete, and are a pain
to make holes in, so maybe paper would be better.]

Risk Assessment: 

DESCRIPTION

Perspex tubes are filled with water, attached to a board. Remove the
bungs from the bottom to let air in. Watch different bubbles produced.

RISKS

1. Instability of the board +
 +
2. Slip hazard due to spilt water +
 +
3. It is conceivable, although highly unlikely, that a child could drown
in the trough of water. +

ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS

\1. Ensure that the board is properly bolted to the frame. +
 +
2. Use the tray to catch the water. Clean up excessive spillage. Do the
experiment outside. +
 +
 +
3. Demonstrator to reduce risk of trips/falls (see #2) and monitor
experiment at all times. +

ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT

1-3. In the event of injury call first aider. +
