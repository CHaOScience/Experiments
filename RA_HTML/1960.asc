Introduction

Public summary: 

CBS Talk - Go on a journey through time with the Geologise! crew and see
how the study of geology can show what happened millions of years ago.

Travel through time with Geologise! and see how geology can

Useful information

Kit List: 

Various rock samples: fulgurite, coal, sandstone, mudstone, myriapod
tracks +
Toy box with various toys (including toy dinosaur) +
Plastic tank and trays to put the various substances in +
Coloured sand and coloured play-doh and coloured liquid +
Blunt knife to cut the play-doh (with knife cover) +
Paper with different colours on each side +
Camera

Packing Away: 

Clean up any spillages of sand +
Return rock samples to the Earth Sciences department +
Return any other equipment borrowed to the place of origin +
Keep the rest for possible usage in other experiments

Explanation

Explanation: 

The audience enter the time-ship Geologise! and prepare to travel back
in time with the presenters, one of whom has already been back in time
(or that's what he says at least...) Unfortunately, the ship doesn't
manage to time travel so they have to use the study of rocks to
understand what happened millions of years ago.

Relative Dating: +
Use layers of play-doh and different coloured sand in a tank to show the
principles of stratigraphy - that layers of sediment form one on top of
the other. Show how different processes can happen to the sequence of
rocks to perturb the original stratigraphy, and the techniques used to
unpick the chronology. Possibly inject a coloured liquid to a layer
underneath to show how igneous rocks can cut across others. Show
faulting (cut the play-doh using a blunt knife) and folding in the
sequence to show how rocks can be offset at the surface. Get a toy
dinosaur from the toy box (throwing the other soft toys carefully out
behind them) and get a member of the audience to make footprints in the
play-doh layer of the stratigraphy, and show how they can be preserved.
Talk about unconformities and the concept of 'missing time' in relation
to Hutton's Unconformity. The sand can also show varying sedimentation
rates.

Absolute Dating: +
All well and good being able to tell which rock was laid down first, but
what time exactly did the rock form. Explain radiogenic isotope dating
and the concept of half-life. Give the audience (shown on the screen
with a camera, or a small group of children at the front) a piece of
paper with a different colour on each side and get them to hold it up.
Get half of the room after a certain amount of time to turn the cards
over, and then half of the remaining group, and so on. The number of one
colour relative to the other shows how old something is.

Different Environments: +
The various layers of play-doh and sand can represent different rock
formations found in a sample area (such as Arran, show the geological
map) and each one captures a different environment. The Devonion Old Red
Sandstone with large pebbles in a sandy matrix formed from an arid
environment with river systems (show samples). The Carboniferous mud and
coal deposits formed in a tropical environment with many trees and large
insects like the myriapod (show the myriapod footprints and what can be
deduced about the myriopod from this, think about fossil preservation in
general). The Permian New Red Sandstone formed in a desert environment
with occasional storms (show the fulgurite formed by lightning, get a
child to feel the inside of it to show it has fused, shows the sandstone
formed above ground).

The talk concludes with the point that you don't need to travel in time
to work out what happened millions of years ago, and in fact it is more
useful to look at a whole series of rocks laid down over a long period
of time as it shows how things changed, rather than just a single
snapshot. All this is summarised in a song play on the keyboard and sung
in harmony: Geology's like travelling in time...

Risk Assessment: 

*Experiment*

*Relative Dating and Stratigraphy*

*Faults and Folding*

*Footprints and trace fossils*

*Half-Life: Holding up different coloured cards*

*Different Environments: Various rock and fossil samples*

*Music, Sounds and Lights*

*Description*

Pour sand into a tank, then overlay with various colours of play-doh,
eventually injecting a coloured liquid through the side

Cut the layers of play-doh in the tank with a knife and offset them,
also folding other parts

Get a toy dinosaur out of the toybox (after throwing out some other
toys) and get an audience member to make imprints of the dinosaur in the
play-doh

Get the audience to hold up pieces of paper and turn them over. Either
project view of audience with a camera or get a few audience memebrs
down to the front to do this

Showing the samples to the audience via the projector and an audience
member feeling the inside of the fulgurite

Some flashing lights, occasional sounds and a song from a keyboard

*Hazard*

Sand/liquid could get on the floor and make it slippy

Liquid could get on electrical parts

Knife could cut presenter or audience member if left unattended

Toys could hit audience members

Audience member could drop toy dinosaur on foot

Audience coming down to the front could trip

Audience coming down to the front could trip

Paper cut from turning paper over

Handling heavy rocks and may drop on the floor/feet

Audience member could cut finger on sharp parts of fulgurite

Loud music and bright flashing lights may cause damage to eyes and ears,
or may cause seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.

*Action To Be Taken To Minimise Risks*

Keep all substances within the tank and other containers, and also
within a tray

Mop up any spillages promptly

Keep electrical equipment away from any liquids

Keep knife in a holder and make sure it is never left unattended.
Concentrate when cutting

Throw only lightweights toys behind in a careful fashion

Get audience member to hold the toy dinosaur carefully in two hands and
place carefully back on the table

Say to watch out for cables on the way to the floor and then make sure
there are no cables in the demonstration area. Gaffer loose cables down
if necessary

Say to be careful with the paper

Say to watch out for cables on the way to the floor and then make sure
there are no cables in the demonstration area. Gaffer loose cables down
if necessary

Hold rocks carefully in two hands and place carefully back on the table

Make sure the audience member just touches the smooth part and tell them
to be careful

Keep the music at a low sound level and the lights at a low level,
warning people that there will be some flashing lights

*Action To Be Taken In The Event Of An Accident*

Call first aider in event of injury

Clean up spills.

Cordon off the spillage area and turn electrical equipment off

Call first aider if required

Call first aider in event of injury

Call first aider in event of injury.

Call first aider in event of injury

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
