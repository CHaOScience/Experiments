Explanation
Explanation: 

Taken from Dave's Naked Scientists explanation: [http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/psyche...](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/psychedelic-milk/ "http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/psychedelic-milk/") <span class="print-footnote">\[1\]</span>

**In a nutshell**
Investigate how reducing surface tension can lead to pretty patterns that move in milk using food colouring and washing up liquid.

**How to set up the experiment**
1) Add about 1cm depth of milk to the bottom of your bowl.
2) Pour a few drops of each colour of food colouring onto different places on the surface of the milk (be sparing)
3) Add a drop of washing up liquid somewhere in the bowl.
4) The food colouring moves! You should find that at first the food colouring moves away from where you added the washing up liquid, and then it starts welling up from below the surface of the milk, forming beautiful patterns.
5) After a minute or so and everything has stopped moving, add another somewhere else.

**What you need to know during the event**
1) Milk is mostly water, and water has a property called surface tension. This is because all the water molecules are strongly attracted to other water molecules, but not to air. Therefore the water molecules try to make the surface (the interface between the water and air) as small as possible. This is why raindrops are approximately spherical - the shape with the minimal surface for its volume.

2) The food colouring is less dense than the milk so it floats on the surface. This is because the milk has lots of substances dissolved in it such as calcium, making it more dense than the food colouring (which is almost entirely water).

3) Washing up liquid is designed to reduce the surface tension so water can dissolve fats and grease. This means that where you add the washing up liquid, the surface tension is much weaker than everywhere else. The surfactant spreads across the surface away from the drop, making the rest of the surface shrink.

4) The food colouring is forced downwards and there is a current below the surface flowing back towards the washing up liquid pulling the food colouring along. It then floats back up to the surface producing beautiful patterns.

**Want to know more?**
A washing up liquid molecule is made up of a water loving head and a water hating tail, so when you add it to water the molecules arrange themselves over the surface - head inwards. The water is strongly attracted to the heads of these molecules, so is now stops trying to reduce its surface area, and the surface tension is far weaker.

The bubbles in washing up liquid are not originally there - they get added because people associate bubbles with cleanliness...
