Introduction

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Adding numbers using a mechanical calculator

Useful information

Kit List: 

The binary adder +
A bag of marbles

Packing Away: 

It goes into a cardboard box.

Explanation

Explanation: 

A mechanical binary adder, which adds two numbers represented by
marbles. +
Get people to figure out what it does by repeatedly adding one, see if
they can spot how to read a number off or add a number other than one.
Talk about how this is how computers represent numbers. Why do they use
something different? Easy to store in this format instead of 10 possible
digits we only have one, we can then store this as +ve or -ve, on/off or
something like that. +
There's also options to talk about logic, very easy switches for
operations AND and XOR (exclusive or). How do we add numbers using
these? AND to see if we need to carry one, XOR tells us if what we need
in that bit. +
You can also demonstrate overflow by adding big numbers together. +
You could talk about how computers store negative numbers, sign and
magnitude is probably most obvious way of doing it. There's also 2's
complement. Or you could talk about fractions and storing the number of
halves, quaters... or as numerator denominator. +
If you wanted you can even get people to play about with finger binary.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |A mechanical binary calculator

|RISKS |1. Possibility of sharp edges or splinters on the model, if
damaged +
 +
2. Marbles could present a slip hazard if dropped +
3. Children may eat marbles

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Check for damage before
demonstrating, and avoid knocking or dropping during use +
 +
2. Keep unused marbles in a container, and keep track of how many there
are +
3. Watch children with the marbles, only give them one at a time to
immediately put in the machine.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
event of injury
