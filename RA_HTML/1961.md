Where Are All the Aliens
========================

<span class="submitted">Sun, 12/02/2017 - 23:46 — Andrew Sellek</span>
Introduction
Public summary: 

CBS Talk 2017

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

CBS Talk 2017

Explanation
Explanation: 

Demos:
• Model planets, possibly held up by volunteers
• Squeezing/stretching a squash ball or elastic band to show heating effect
• Getting volunteers to orbit one another, one holding a torch to illustrate day/night and year
• Passing planets in front of a lamp to simulate transits
• Swinging a ball on a rope to show how Newton’s third law causes a star to wobble
• Shining a laser pointer through a diffraction grating to show how spectra are taken
• Cooling water in two different sized beakers to show that high surface area to volume ratio cools things quicker

Risk Assessment: 

**RISK**
**ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE**
**ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT**
Tripping or falling on dropped planets or squash ball
If using volunteers, ask them not to throw balls or run after them.
If ball dropped, demonstrator (not audience) to pick up immediately. In case of accident contact first aider.
Swallowing of or choking on small parts used for some planets
Don’t give small planets to children.
In case of ingestion, call first aider.
Torch being shone in eyes
Use a fairly low power LED torch as these are safe, ask children to keep it away from eyes.
If someone is dazzled by lights, switch off lights and sit them down until they have recovered. Check they are ok before letting them walk around again!
Lamp being shone in eyes
Use a screen between lamp and audience
If someone is dazzled, then switch off lights and ensure they are ok.
Lamp screen falling over
Secure to table and not too near edge. Be careful not to knock.
In case of accident, call first aider.
Tripping, falling or feeling dizzy when emulating orbits/diurnal rotation
Ensure that actions are carried out slowly e.g. by walking, not running
If dizziness occurs, sit down until recovered. Call first aider in event of injury.
Scalding/burning from hot water
Let water cool to lukewarm before using in demo. Do not overfill vessels and leave away from edges of tables. Do not handle hot vessels.
In case of scalds/burns contact first aider.
Spillages of water
Leave vessels away from edges of tables where they might be knocked, only handle if comfortable temperature.
If spillage occurs, dry up immediately if safe temperature or cordon off area until safe to do so.
Breaking of glassware or thermometers
Leave vessels away from edges of tables, make sure thermometers will not topple or roll before leaving.
Clear up any breakages and spillages. In case of injury or contact with thermometer contents, call first aider.
Elastic band snapping – unlikely possibility of injury
Encourage volunteers not to over stretch bands
In unlikely event of injury, contact first aider.
Swinging ball on rope: potential for ball to fly off / rope to snap.
Only have demonstrator do this – make sure rope securely attached to hand by wrist strap. Perform in lots of space and keep low.
If causes breakage – clear up any dangers.
If causes injury then contact first aider.
Electrical Hazards – potentially kettle, lamp
See electrical parts RA
See electrical parts RA
Laser pointer being shone in eyes
Only allow demonstrator to touch the laser pointers; point the laser pointers towards the front wall so that nobody is facing the beam; do not shine at mirrored surfaces; ensure everybody is sitting down before shining it so that nobody moves into its path.
In case of accident contact first aider.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk assessment.
