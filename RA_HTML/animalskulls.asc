Introduction

Public summary: 

Why do some animals have really long beaks? Why do others have really
big TEETH? With our collection of animal skulls, you can find out how
different animals evolved to suit their habitats - and how you are a lot
more similar to them than you might think!

Explanation

Explanation: 

***OVERVIEW***

We have some skulls of different animals. Each has different adaptations
relating to the animal’s lifestyle and environment. Looking at a skull’s
characteristics, such as teeth, eye placement and size, scientists can
determine whether the animal was an herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore,
and if the animal was a predator or prey animal.

***SETTING OUT THE EXPERIMENT*** +
In a calm event it can be nice to set out all the skulls on a table,
with all the photo cards spread out in front of them so that you can
play a matching game. In a busier event or with an excited group of kids
it's probably better to have them in the big blue boxes and pull out one
skull at a time. That makes it easier to control which kids are holding
the skull(s) and it makes it easier to control the questions, as you
don't have to jump backwards and forwards between lots of different
animals!

***BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION***

Unlike some of the other biology experiments, the animal skulls
experiment has no fixed story line. This makes it much more flexible, so
you can talk about the skulls that you find cool or know more about.
(No-one will know which ones you've left in the box!).

Our advice is to start talking about one skull in detail, then compare
other skulls to the first one you picked. It's easier to pick one of the
bigger/ less fragile skulls first, such as the human (made of plastic!)
or the sheep skull. Make sure that you've established what a skull is on
the first one- it's not as obvious as you might think that it's the
boney stuff that is inside our head/ protects our brain. You might also
want to briefly talk about what bones are for/ made of - an explanation
of hard stuff that holds our bodies up is probably enough detail for the
youngest kids!

* Start by asking the child if they recognise any of the skulls - they
will probably recognise the human one at least +
* On the human skull - can ask if they know the names of any parts of
the skull (can help them out by providing a couple - remember to use
simple terms e.g. teeth, eye sockets) +
* Point out interesting points on the skull that you might know e.g.
foramen magnum where the spine attaches to the skull and through which
the spinal cord runs, or the holes on either side of the skull where the
inner ear goes +
* Once you've established the names of a few of the skull's main
features, ask the child if they know what each of these features does or
what they're for +
* Point out that the jaw isn't fixed to the main part of the skull -
apart from anything else we wouldn't be able to open our mouths to eat
if it was stuck (fused) to the rest of the skull. +
* Holes for nerves, such as at the back of the eye sockets. These allow
the brain to connect to send and receive signals from the rest of the
body. +
* Can then move onto the other skulls - discuss the features of the
skulls and how these relate to the demands that the animal has to cope
with in its environment. Why might the adaptations help the animal to
succeed in its environment/why might the animal have developed these
skull features? You might want to discuss each skull in turn, or you may
prefer to talk about a particular 'theme' i.e. teeth, brain size across
a number of skulls at once +
* Make sure you get child involved i.e. get them to (gently!) handle
skulls so they can feel how delicate/sturdy they are, ask lots of
questions. Remember to use simple language and explain difficult words
in simpler terms (e.g. 'animals that come out at night' rather than
'nocturnal animals')

Interesting features/comparisons include:

TEETH

The type, shape and number of teeth an animal has can help determine its
diet.

- Incisors are the front teeth. They are used primarily for cutting and
grasping. +
- Canines are the teeth next to the incisors. The canine teeth typically
are large in a predator and are used for tearing and grasping. +
- Premolars are the teeth behind the canines. These teeth have sharp
edges for crushing food. +
- Molars are the very back teeth. They are broad and flat and are used
for grinding.

If a mammal has long, sharp canines, it is most likely a predator.
Canines are used for grabbing, holding and killing prey. Some
meat-eating mammals (carnivores) have sharp shearing cheek-teeth called
carnassials. These teeth act like a scissor to cut through tough flesh
and to break it into smaller pieces for swallowing and digestion. The
fox is mainly carnivorous, although they also gather a wide variety of
other foods like fruit and berries. The European Mole is also
carnivorous, and feeds on invertebrates e.g. earthworms, insects. Ask
the child if they can think of any other carnivores (cats and dogs are
just two familiar carnivores).

Plant eating animals tend to have teeth specialized in chewing various
parts of plants. Some plant eaters eat grasses (grazers e.g. sheep,
using incisors to nip plants close to their bases), some eat twigs,
leaves and berries (browsers e.g. goats/deer) while others eat only
specific plant parts (i.e. roots, fruit, etc.). In order to properly
digest vegetation, an animal must chew its food to help break down the
plant. Most herbivores have cheek teeth called molars. These molars help
grind leaves, stems, grasses, fruit and even seeds before the animal
swallows them. Examples of herbivores in our skull collection include
the hare (hares eat grasses during the summer and twigs/tree bark etc.
during the winter, and also commonly re-ingest their faecal pellets...)
and the sheep (these mainly feed on grasses, have a large and complex
stomach which is able to digest highly fibrous foods that cannot be
digested by many other animals). Sheep, cows, llamas and alpacas all
don't have top inscisors! Instead they have a thick, hardened gum line
(called the dental pad) which they use to pinch off blades of grass
against.

Some animals (omnivores) eat both plants and animals, and have both
types of teeth. The human and magpie are omnivores (although obviously
the mapgpie doesn’t have any teeth). Interestingly though, recent
studies have shown that chickens (and possibly other bird species) still
retain the genetic blueprints to produce teeth in the jaws, although
these are dormant in living animals. These are a feature from primitive
birds such as Archaeopteryx, which were descended from theropod
dinosaurs.

We also have an Orangutan jaw - Orangutans find their food in the trees
where they live. More than half their diet consists of fruit. They also
eat nuts, bark, and other parts of plants and trees. Every once in a
while they eat insects such as ants and termites, as well as bird eggs.
Other examples of omnivores include pigs and bears.

BEAKS

You might want to talk about how birds such as the chicken use their
beaks to feed, and talk about how other birds have adapted their beaks
to help them eat their chosen food.

The beak of a bird is an extension of its skull and is designed for
feeding. Some beaks have evolved to specialize for feeding on specific
items.

Duck: wide flattened "bill" used for eating aquatic plants and mosses -
specialised for "dredging" type jobs. Dabbling ducks, which feed on the
surface of the water (or as deep as they can reach by upending without
completely submerging) have a comb like structure along the edge of
their beak called a pectin - this strains the water squirting from the
side of the beak and traps any food. Also used to preen feathers.

Parrots: seeds are the most important part of their diet, which has led
to the evolution of a large and powerful bill which is primarily an
adaptation to opening and consuming seeds.

Oystercatcher: bill shape varies between species, according to diet -
birds with blade like bill tips pry open or smash mollusc shells, and
those with pointed bill tips tend to probe for annelid worms.

Pigeons: homing pigeons have iron containing structures in their beaks
which may enable the birds to use the earth's magnetic field for
navigation

Other birds (which we don't have, but that you could discuss) include -
the hawk, which has a sharp hooked beak used in tearing flesh from its
prey or carrion. A hummingbird uses its long narrow beak to lap nectar
from flowers and a sparrow has a small powerful beak used for picking
berries and cracking seeds.

NOSES

Possibly start by asking what is missing (nose, ears, eyes and other
soft tissues) - they are not part of the skeleton, made of either
cartilige or muscles and nerves. The kids can think about the
differences in nose sizes, do they think that cats have a better sense
of smell than dogs? etc (dogs are 10,000 times more sensitive to odors
than humans). Apart from food, what else do animals need noses for?
(smelling mould, predators, recognising family members, detecting when
another animal is in heat). The sheep skull has large nasal cavities,
with delicate rolls of (turbinate) bones, which support a large area of
nasal epithelium (skin inside the nose (?)) for many, many scent
receptors and to reduce heat/moisture loss.

EYE PLACEMENT AND SIZE (particularly relevant to mammals)

Large eye sockets suggest an animal is active at night (nocturnal). In
this case, a larger eye has evolved to allow the animal to see better at
night. Moles are nocturnal, hunting prey and remaining active at night.

Eyes that face forward on a skull suggest a predator (‘an animal that
hunts other animals for food’). Forward facing eyes allow for binocular
or stereoscopic vision, which allows an animal to see and judge depth.
Predators need this depth perception to track and pursue prey. +
The fox is an example of a predator in our collection. The orangutan
also has forward facing eyes that give it depth perception needed to
swing and leap in their tree top habitat. Humans have forward facing
eyes as well (you could talk here about us being descended from apes).

Animals with eyes that are located on the side of its head would suggest
a prey animal. Side eye placement allows for greater peripheral or side
vision. This enables the animal to see predators approaching from the
side as well as from behind. This vision is very important for
protecting an animal when it is grazing or feeding. The hare is an
example of a prey animal in our collection. Other examples include deer
and rabbits.

"Eyes in the front, the animal hunts. Eyes on the side, the animal
hides."

CRANIUM

The size of an animal’s cranium (relative to its body size) can give you
an idea of how well developed its cerebral cortex (the part of the brain
that contributes to ‘intelligence’) is. The size of an animal’s cerebral
cortex indicates how much ‘processing power’ its brain has in addition
to the basic functions that all animals’ brains need to perform (such as
control of breathing, feeding and movement, which involve the
hindbrain). A good way to compare the size of the brain cavity is to
look at how big it is relative to the rest of the animal’s skull.
Generally, social animals such as monkeys, apes (including humans),
dolphins, and elephants have large cerebral cortices. This is because
keeping track of social relations within the group requires a great deal
of ‘processing power’.

Magpies are a member of the corvid family - group of birds including
crows, jackdaws etc. - these birds are thought to be the most intellgent
of all bird species, and have larger cerebral cortices than would be
expected for their body size. This intelligence is demonstrated in
several ways e.g. European magpies have shown self awareness (i.e.
recognising themselves) in mirror tests, crows and rooks have tool
making abilities (e.g. hooks to 'fish' for grubs) - things that people
generally associate with higher mammals such as ourselves and other
apes. These birds also have highly complex social lives, just like apes
(need to have large brains with lots of computational power to keep
track of what other animals are doing, understand their relationships
with other animals in the group etc.).

Parrots also highly intelligent and have high brain size to body ratio -
some have been shown to be able to associate words with their meanings
and form simple sentences (e.g. Alex the African Grey), some species of
parrots are highly skilled at using tools and solving puzzles.

Pigeons, by contrast, seem to be less "intelligent". If a pigeon is
taught that doing something (e.g. pecking at light A) leads to reward,
and doing something else (e.g. pecking at light B) doesn't, then they
can learn these rules, but if you change the rules around (e.g. pecking
at A doesn't lead to a reward, and pecking at B does) they find it
difficult to "reverse" their behaviour (whereas corvids and humans
manage easily!) Could demonstrate this with child using a coin and
getting them to pick which hand they think it is in).

NB Unlike most other apes, orangutans are shy, solitary animals. They
live alone in large territories. This is probably due to their eating
habits; they need a large area in order to get enough food and too many
orangutans in one area might lead to starvation. However, they are very
intelligent. They have been known to use found objects as tools; for
example, they use leaves as umbrellas to keep the rain from getting them
wet. They also use leaves as cups to help them drink water.

*** OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ***

Can the child think of any other distinctively-shaped skulls that
animals have, and why might they have developed to be like that? E.g.
crocodile, hammerhead shark, elephant (tusks)...

If the child is old enough and seems keen, you might want to touch on
the concept of natural selection (survival of the fittest) and how this
drives development of the peculiar features that some animals have. For
example nocturnal animals will have more success catching food and
escaping predators if they have large eyes that let in as much light as
possible in low light conditions. Animals with smaller eyes than average
will find it more difficult to do this and are less likely to survive
than animals with larger than average eyes. The animals with larger eyes
will therefore be more likely to survive and have babies, who will in
turn also have big eyes like their parents (you will need to briefly
touch on genetics here too – has the child noticed that they share the
same eye/hair/skin colour/nose shape etc with their parents?)

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Comparing different real and plastic animal skulls

|RISKS a|
Some skulls may have sharp teeth or beaks.

If dropped, skulls may fall on feet or shatter, causing cuts and other
injuries.

Possible infection risk from bone if skin is cut by touching the bone

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Remind children to handle skulls carefully; in particular, be careful
not to pinch fingers/hands in the jaw.

Demonstrator only have a few skulls present at a time to minimise risk
of children picking up or playing with skulls. Demonstrator to keep an
eye on anybody holding skulls. If a skull smashes, clear it up
immediately with dustpan and brush. Any skulls with sharp edges may need
to be smoothed off or replaced.

We have boiled the skulls we found in bleach for a few hours to
sterilise them. Please note, however, this does not necessarilly mean
that the skulls are completely sterile now.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
In case of injury call first aider.

Warn parents of the possibility of infection if a child does cut
him/herself on the skull; Advise parents to take child to a doctor if
the cut looks infected.
