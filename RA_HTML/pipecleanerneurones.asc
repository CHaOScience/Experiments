Introduction

Public summary: 

Neurones are cells in your brain, that connect to lots of other
neurones. Make some brains cells yourself with brightly coloured
pipecleaners and the expert help of one of our demonstrators.

Useful information

Kit List: 

Pipe cleaners - some full-length, others 1/3 length (cut using wire
snips *caution - keep these hidden when demonstrating as they're very
sharp!*)

Note: there should also hopefully be a model of a brain in the same
box...

Frequency of use: 

2

Explanation

Explanation: 

This is a great way to explain the basic concepts of what nerves are and
what they do. You'll be getting the kids to make a simple neuron from
different coloured pipe cleaners. Each colour will represent a different
part of the neuron e.g. cell body, axon, dendrites, myelin sheath!

1. Take one pipe cleaner and roll it into a ball. This is will be the
cell body.

2.Take another pipe cleaner and attach it to the new "cell body" by
pushing it through the ball so there are two halves sticking out. Take
the two halves and twist them together into a single extension. This
will be the axon.

3.Take other pipe cleaners and push them through the "cell body" on the
side opposite the axon. These are dendrites. These can be shorter than
your axon and you can twist more pipe cleaners to make more dendrites.

4.Wrap small individual pipe cleaners along the length of the axon.
These will represent the myelin sheath.

5. Wrap another pipe cleaner on the end of the axon. This will be the
synaptic terminal.

Background information about neurones:

image:http://www.chaosscience.org.uk/sites/default/files/neurone1.gif[image]

Our nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord, together
the central nervous system) is one of the ways we send messages around
the body, working alongside hormones (chemicals that travel in our
bloodstream). The nervous system uses electricity (but much lower
voltages and currents than we use to run lightbulbs!!) to transmit these
messages. A major component of the nervous system is the neurones.
Neurones (also called neurons or nerve cells) are electrically excitable
cells - with information travelling down the axon by shuffling of ions
(charged particles). At synapses (connections with other neurons)
chemical transmission is used, with molecules moving between the
neurones across the synaptic cleft.

A number of specialized types of neurone exist: sensory neurones respond
to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli. They send information
from the periphery to the central nervous system. Motor neurones send
signals the other way, from the central nervous system to muscles at the
periphery and cause e.g. muscle contractions.

A typical neurone consists of 3 parts: the cell body (soma), dendrites
and the axon. The nucleus ('control centre of the cell' as it's
described in schools) is located in the cell body. Dendrites are lots of
branches from the cell body that receive signals from other neurones.
The axon is very thin and conducts electrical impulses away from the
cell body, towards the axon termini where the neurone forms synapses
with other neurones. The longest axons in the human body are of the
sciatic nerve which runs from the base of the spine to the big toe of
each foot! These single cells can be more than a metre long!

In vertebrates, the axon is insulated by a sheath of myelin, formed from
Schwann cells. Loss of myelin from axons is found in people with
multiple sclerosis. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps (approx a
micrometre long) in the sheath known as nodes of Ranvier occur at
evenly- +
spaced intervals (action potentials jump between these sites where ion
channels are found in a manner known as saltatory conduction, but this
is probably way above the heads of the majority of your audience for
this experiment! - essentially myelination makes the messages travel
faster). Even in vertebrates there are some unmeylinated axons because
myelin uses up lots of space and you wouldn't be able to fit enough
neurones into our bodies if they all had myelin sheaths - so neurones
which need to conduct messages really quickly are myelinated.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Making model neurons out of pipe cleaners.

|RISKS a|
Kids getting pipe cleaners in their eyes or swallowing small bits of
pipe cleaners. Wire core of pipe cleaner could potentially case cuts.

Wire snips are very sharp and could potentially cause cuts.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Ensure that children are carefully supervised; demonstrator to try to
keep all neuron-making activity on the table. Demonstrator should calm
down children if they are using the pipe cleaners in an unsafe way.

Keep wire snips hidden during demonstrating - they're only used to
prepare pipe cleaners beforehand so don't need to be out.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call a first aider
immediately; do not attempt to move anything lodged in the eye.
