Introduction
Study light using a CD as a diffraction grating.

Explanation
Explanation: 

Looking at different light sources using a CD as a diffraction grating. Colour mixing with LED colour mixer. Splitting light with a Lens.

Look at a fluorescent, conventional light bulb, LED etc in a CD to see that they don't have the same spectrum.

Split light (and with any luck recombining it) with a prism

Mix red, green and blue light to form other colours.

Risk Assessment: 

Looking at spectra of different light sources, using both a CD as a diffraction grating and prisms to split light. Mixing red, green and blue LED light to produce different colours.

Risks:
1. Looking at the light from the sun could damage eyes
2. If examining the spectra from light bulbs, bulbs could be broken
3. Glass prisms may be dropped and broken.
4. Looking at the light from bright LEDs may cause eye damage
5. Bulbs may become warm if left on for long periods of time.

Control Measures:
1. Never look at the spectra of the sun, or look directly at the light from the sun, without proper filters in place.
2. Try to keep lamps where they are not easily knocked over.
3. Keep the prisms away from the edge of the table.
4. Make sure that people don't look into the LEDs in the light mixing box.
5. Turn bulbs off when not in use, avoid leaving them on for long periods.

In case of accident:
1-5. Call first aider in the event of injury. Inform a committee member of the accident.
2. Ensure power to light is turned off, keep public away from broken glass, and clear up immediately.
3. Keep the public away from the broken glass and clear up immediately.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk assessment.

This experiment is sometimes run in a darkroom, see separate risk assessment.
