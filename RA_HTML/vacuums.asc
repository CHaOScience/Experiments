Introduction

Public summary: 

The idea of a vaccum is very different to what we experience in everyday
life, with some surprising consequences! Oh, and the experiment involves
balloons too!

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

General public

Various demonstrations using a vacuum pump.

Explanation

Explanation: 

There are lots of different bits to this experiment, and there is
probably too much to do with any given group of people. Here are some of
the things that can be done:

[[particle-theory]]
Particle Theory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good way to start (I think, depends on the age group) is often good to
ask what the surroundings are made of, solids liquids gases etc, and
introduce the idea of particles (kids, even young ones may have heard of
atoms or molecules). You can talk about how particles behave in each
state of matter, and then start to focus on the air around you. Many
kids will know the names of the gases that make up the atmosphere, so
that’s a nice question to ask, then you can explain that you get lots of
these gas particles zooming around, but that you can’t normally feel
them. Example, wind blowing you backwards. You can also explain that
many, many particles bump into you each second, but because you're used
to it you don't notice (and your body has evolved to deal with it, if
they're old enough to know about evolution). Maybe make a comparison,
such as a bag of flour (1kg) on an area the size of a postage stamp
(1cm^2).

[[weighing-air]]
Weighing Air
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Does air weigh anything? Most kids (and adults!) will answer no to this
question when asked it straight off, it links in quite nicely with the
hot air balloon experiment where we argue that it floats because some
air gets forced out of the bottom of the balloon making it lighter. Have
a discussion about the difficulties in weighing air. A good analogy is a
swimming pool; if you try to lift someone in the pool they feel much
lighter than in the air. There may be a plastic pint glass on a piece of
string in the box; so if you have a bucket of water you can test the
weight of a glass when it is:

1.  Empty, hanging above the water.
2.  Full, hanging above the water.
3.  Full, hanging in the water.

Get a volunteer to say heavy/light in each case. This should get across
the idea that when you weigh something the surroundings matter. Now you
can measure the weight of air itself. Take the plastic Vacuum chamber
and put it on the scales. You can tare them to zero if you want, but
this leaves you with a confusing negative mass measurement. Attach on
the tube and then get someone to read the mass off, make sure no-one is
touching it/leaning on the table too hard! Turn on the pump and
(hopefully) they should see the mass go down by around 10g. (be very
clear about what the pump is doing...lots of kids will be confused and
think it's pumping air in rather than out!) Talk about how heavy this
is, try weighing a marker pen/bunch of keys for comparison. So air
really does weigh something!

[[expanding-balloon]]
Expanding balloon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Put a partly inflated balloon into the chamber. Evacuate the air from
the chamber and see the balloon expand. Open the tap and it will shrink
again (and if you do it too fast, it will shred into lots of pieces to
the amusement of all). Talk about why this happens. No air can get in or
out of the balloon, there are always the same number of particles inside
it. Can talk about particles bashing against the inside and the outside
of the rubber, when you remove them from the outside the balloon can
expand more easily. You can even use a child tapping the palm of your
hand on either side to demonstrate the point that if the tapping on one
side gets taken away your hand moves. For a cheap "urgh!"; what would
happen if I put you into a Vacuum chamber?

[[how-strong-is-the-vacuum]]
How strong is the Vacuum?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other two experiments will have got across the idea that a Vacuum
sucks things. Can talk about how this links in to Vacuum cleaners, which
use pressure differences to suck up dirt (this is probably the only
place they will have heard the word Vacuum before). Don't let them try
to pull the lid off the plastic chamber (though they can put fingers on
the end of the tap to feel the sucking effect!), but we have a metal
Vacuum chamber that they can pull at hard! Evacuate it and let everyone
have a go at pulling it apart. Can talk about the fact that you're
fighting to pull against the millions and millions of air particles all
bashing against the outside pushing it together.

[[vacuum-bazooka]]
Vacuum Bazooka
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This leads nicely into the Vacuum bazooka experiment, which has a
separate explanation/risk assessment (and can't be done in confined
spaces!).

Risk Assessment

Risk Assessment: 

Pumping on vacuum chambers to see what happens when you evacuate various
things.

[[risks]]
Risks:
^^^^^^

1.  The chamber could implode, throwing things out.
2.  The pump will produce oil mist in the exhaust.
3.  Risk of falling over when two people trying to seperate metal vacuum
chamber by "tug of war" method (especially if unexpectedly successful)

[[control-measures]]
Control Measures:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Use a polycarbonate dessicator as the chamber, as polycarbonate
doesn't shatter. Check chambers for damage before using them. Only put a
rubber balloon inside the chamber. +
 +
Can also use a metal vacuum chamber as this will not implode
2.  The exhaust from the pump is fitted with an air filter.
3.  Don't allow "tug of war" in a confined space/area with risk of
bumping into sharp objects/other hazards, sometimes best to make both
parties sit down first. If group is (showing signs of becoming) over
excited best for demonstrator to hold one end of the chamber to maintain
control

[[in-case-of-accident]]
In case of accident:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Call first aider in case of injury.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
