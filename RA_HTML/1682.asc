Introduction

Public summary: 

By comparing sizes and distances we can scale our solar system all the
way up from the Earth and the Moon, up to our nearest star, and you
might be surprised how far that actually is!

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

By comparing sizes and distances we can scale our solar system all the
way up from the Earth and the Moon, up to our nearest star, and you
might be surprised how far that actually is!

Useful information

Kit List: 

Golf ball - Moon +
Globe - Earth +
Marbles - Earth/Sun on different scales +
Red foam ball - Jupiter +
Card with pin-prick hole - Sun/Solar system on bigger scales

Packing Away: 

Don't lose your marbles!

Explanation

Explanation: 

For globe earth: +
Golf Ball moon - at a distance of 4m +
c=6ms-1

For 2m (roughly demonstrator height) Sun: +
Earth marble +
Jupiter ball +
c=1ms-1 (GUESS!?!)

Sun marble +
Earth 2m away +
Jupiter 10m +
Neptune 60m

Sun 1mm (pin prick hole in card) +
Neptune 4m +
Alpha Centauri 29km

Solar System (sun to neptune) 1mm +
Alpha Centauri 10m

Risk Assessment

Date risk assesment last checked: 

Wed, 11/01/2017

Risk assesment checked by: 

Roxanne

Date risk assesment double checked: 

Wed, 01/02/2017

Risk assesment double-checked by: 

Mattlem

Risk Assessment: 

Potential risk: +
1) Tripping or falling +
2) Ball rolling off and getting underfoot +
3) Small balls used in some parts of the experiment being swallowed

Solution: +
1) Demonstrator must emphasise that children must walk, should stop
everyone walking to actually do explanations +
2) Must be made very clear to children that they may not kick or throw
the balls ever +
3) Do not use small balls parts of experiment for audiences of very
young children
