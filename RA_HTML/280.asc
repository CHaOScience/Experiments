Useful information

Kit List: 

For Crash, Bang, Squelch! the specimens are acquired by pond dipping
around Cambridge +
For the summer roadshow and other events, specimens may be acquired from
ponds (freshwater) or rock pools (saltwater) locally +
Identification charts (sourced from the field studies council) +
Pond dipping net and bucket (see
http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/articles/dipping.html[Microscopy
UK guide to pond dipping] [1]) +
White trays +
Aeration pump, tube and stone +
Plastic pasteur pipettes +
Possibly a microscope and some petri dishes +
Possibly also pH paper, or water testing sticks

Packing Away: 

Empty pond life back into suitable habitat +
Thoroughly wash trays/nets

Explanation

Explanation: 

Using identification charts to look at and identify pond life (either
with the naked eye or with the aid of a microscope). Can be extended to
testing water quality, using invertebrates as indicator species.

You'll have the pond/rock pool water and creatures in a white tray to
make it easy to see them. Let the kids choose a creature to identify
then use the pictures/flow charts on the identification sheets to help
you.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Demonstrate and identify aquatic life using a light
microscope

|RISKS |1. Risk of slipping/tripping/falling or getting caught by the
tide when collecting specimens from pond or rock pool. +
2. Possible infection from infectious microbes in water. +
3. Accidental ingestion of organisms by misbehaving children. +
4. Slipping on a wet floor. +
5. Electrical hazard from microscope, especially in conjunction with
water.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Send two demonstrators to
collect specimens and exercise caution when choosing location (e.g. make
sure there is something solid to stand on near the edge of the water).
Check tide tables/observe the tide movement before going to rock pools
to collect specimens. Make sure cuts are covered whilst demonstrators
are collecting specimens. +
2. Encourage hand washing after touching experiment. Hand washing
facilities made available. +
3. Supervise children and ensure they do not eat anything from the
aquarium. +
4. Clear up spills. +
5. If water is spilled on microscope, turn it off, clear up, then turn
it on again. Ensure microscope has been PA tested within the past 2
years. See separate electrical parts risk assessment.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
case of injury. If child ingests anything from the aquarium, advise
parents to take child to GP if child becomes ill.
|=======================================================================

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
