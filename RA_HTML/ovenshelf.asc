Explanation

Explanation: 

Get very strange sounds from an oven shelf. Hang it from two pieces of
string, wrap string around your fingers, put your fingers in your ears,
hit the oven shelf. It will sound like big ben!

*Why does it happen?*

First of all we have to understand that sound is all about vibrations.
When somebody speaks, their voice box vibrates, and this makes the air
around it vibrate. These vibrations carry information about what someone
has just said. When these vibrations reach your ear, they make your
eardrum vibrate and this is processed by your brain as sound. The amount
of energy (or the volume of the sound) that manages to make the journey
from voice box to ear depends on what the sound is travelling through
and what kind of sound it is.

In the case of speaking to a friend or when you listen to the oven
shelf, the vibrations must travel through air. Air is really sloppy,
fluid and not very stiff. Water is quite similar - if you put your hand
in water and slowly move it around, the water feels very soft and
fluidic. However, if you slap the water then it suddenly feels very hard
and stiff. This is because the water doesn't have time to get out of the
way so it has to form waves. Although it is not quite so obvious, this
is the same for air. If you move something through it very quickly, the
air feels stiffer and it's much harder to move through it, so high
frequency vibrations will transfer more energy into the air.

The ability of sound to reach someone's ear also depends on the ability
of the air next to the ear drum to vibrate. In the same way as a high
frequency (pitch) vibration can transfer more energy to the air from the
oven shelf because it has less time to get out of the way, a high
frequency sound will transfer more energy from the air to your eardrum
so the sound is loud. Low frequency sounds vibrate the air much more
slowly, and so the air seems relatively more sloppy and doesn't transfer
energy so well so they sound much quieter. So both low and high
frequency sounds are produced by the oven shelf but it's only the high
frequencies that vibrate the air by your ear drum much so the shelf
sounds tinny and high pitched.

In order to hear the low frequencies, you need to create a stiff
connection between the oven shelf and your ears. The string wrapped
around your fingers provides this connection. The string is taut and
stiff and can transmit both high and low frequencies. When you add the
high and low frequencies together, the oven shelf suddenly sounds like a
gong. +
What about in the real world?

This is why your voice sounds different to everyone else and when you
hear it recorded. Everyone else just hears you though the air, but you
hear yourself through the bones in your skull as well, so different
pitches will reach your ears than other people's.

*Extra information* +
In case someone of a more mathematical background is asking, it's the
impedance mismatch between the shelf and the air that filters out the
low sounds (acting as a high pass filter). We could get those sounds to
the air better if we passed them through a series of media with
different impedances instead of a big jump. The string has an impedance
much closer to that of the shelf (being a solid and all) so there is
less of a mismatch and better transmission.

Risk Assessment: 

Hanging a vibrating oven shelf from two pieces of string wrapped around
your knuckles, which are put in your ears.

*Risks:* +
 +
Minimal, but if fingers are pushed into ears with long nails it could
cause some minor damage.

*Control Measures:* +
 +
Encourage children to put their knuckles, not their fingers, in their
ears.

*In case of accident:* +
 +
Call a first aider.
