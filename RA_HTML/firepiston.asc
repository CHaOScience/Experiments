Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Drive a piston down a cylinder so fast that the air heats
up enough to ignite some cotton wool.

|RISKS a|
1. Risk of tube cracking and firing bits

2. Risk of pushing too hard and damaging demonstrator

3. Risk of burns

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Tube is made out of polycarbonate which is very tough. +
 +
Inspect tube before demonstrating experiment. +
 +
Cover tube in tape/fablon to catch any splinters.

2. Only demonstrate by a demonstrator that is strong/heavy enough and
knows what they are doing.

3. Only demonstrator should handle cotton wool. Put out quickly once
ignited

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
case of injury.
