*** OVERVIEW ***

Seeing Sound uses a signal generator and loudspeaker to make sounds, as
well as various musical instruments. There is a microphone and
oscilloscope to `see' the sound, to allow kids to learn about what sound
waves are and some of their properties. If the oscilloscope isn't
working, a reasonable alternative is to download a free mobile app
instead. If doing this, keep you phone in your possession at all times.

Possible activities: +
- Explaining what sound is, and how you can hear things, using the
signal generator and loudspeaker. +
- Looking at your voice on the oscilloscope when you say different words
and vowels etc. +
- Comparing the voices of different people looking at pitch and
volume. +
- Looking at how simple musical instruments work.

Other things to talk about: +
- How sound travels through the air. +
- How the oscilloscope displays a sound wave.

Tips for demonstrating: +
- Get the whole family to talk into the microphone so that you can look
at the different pitches and volumes of their voices. +
- Get the children to try different vowel sounds, low sounds, and high
sounds etc. +
- There's a lot which can be done in this experiment; you don't have to
do it all, and you don't have to follow the order below...

*** BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION ***

- Start by explaining how we can hear things. Ask the children if they
know anything about waves - water waves, sound waves etc.

- When sound travels through the air, it is in the form of a wave, a
little bit like the waves that you get on the surface of water (although
longitudinal compression wave rather than transverse).

- Use the slinky to show how longitudinal waves travel. Normally we
can't see these waves in the air, but our ears can pick them up.

- Using the signal generator and amplifier, get the loudspeaker
oscillating at 10-20 Hz and get the kids to notice this. If they are
careful they can touch the speaker gently to feel it move.

- Then turn up the frequency so you can hear it (make the connection
between the wobbling and the sound) and can still feel it 50-80Hz. Get
them to feel the air above the speaker they should be able to feel it
moving. Say that the air wobbles above the speaker, and then wobbles all
the way to their ear (you could use the slinky to demonstrate this - a
picture of an ear and loudspeaker may help here too) and your ear hears
the wobbles as sound.

- Turn up the frequency again, and get the kids to make the connection
between speed of vibration and pitch.

- Explain that you can't see sound, because the air is transparent and
it's moving too fast anyway. Then introduce the microphone and
oscilloscope and look at the sound from the loudspeaker. (**As of
mini-tour 2016 the Oscilloscope started smoking so use should not be
attempted unless it has clearly been replaced. There are free mobile
phone apps make a reasonable alternative if your battery can hold out.
The following explanations still hold though!**) The children can also
make some simple noises into the microphone. Vowels are good for this.
Explain that each sound has its own particular shape - saying the
alphabet can prove invaluable here. A long vowel sound should create a
quite stable wave on the 'scope.

- Ask the child to sing a quiet note and a loud note, and see that the
picture drawn gets taller with volume.

- Get child to sing a long note moving from a high note to a low note
(dads may be useful here for very deep notes), and show that the wiggles
on the screen get further apart the lower the note, and closer together
the higher you go. This is a measure of increasing frequency - when
things vibrate faster, we get a higher note (e.g. car accelerating).

- They can also feel their larynx vibrate when they talk - easier with
lower sounds.

- Now for the musical instruments! Let them try to make different notes
with recorder and concertina, and with the big pan pipes from the
resonance experiment. Look at how different pitches, different volumes,
and different timbres (types of note) appear on the oscilloscope.

*** OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ***

- Introduce the idea of wavelength with long wavelengths corresponding
to low frequencies and vice versa.

- A couple of features of the oscilloscope can be explained. You can
explain that the microphone converts the air wobbling into an electrical
wobble which makes the dot on the screen wobble up and down (you can
show this by turning the freq very low on the oscilloscope and you
should be able to see the dot going up and down). Speed the dot up again
a bit and kids can normally work out that fast wobbles make short
wavelengths on the screen, and from stuff earlier they should be able to
work out that high pitch makes short wavelengths too.

- You can go into more detail of the biology of hearing, or use this
point to encourage them to go onto the biology experiments afterwards!

- You can think about why the ear and loudspeaker are the shapes they
are, and why these are quite similar. This is also quite like an
amphitheatre.

*** SCIENCE BACKGROUND FOR DEMONSTRATORS ***

Sound is a longitudinal (compression and rarefaction) wave through the
air. The signal generator produces an oscillating electrical signal,
made bigger by the amplifier; the loudspeaker contains a coil of wire
which acts as an electromagnet, so that the speaker cone oscillates at
the same rate as the signal. We hear because the sound wave makes our
eardrums vibrate: the vibration is passed on through a series of bones
which amplify its magnitude to the cochlea, where tiny hairs inside the
fluid-filled tube pass a signal through the auditary nerve to the brain
when they resonate with the vibrations. (The action of these hairs is
complex, and only recently becoming understood.)

The microphone is capacitative, so needs a battery and resistor (in the
little box) to produce a voltage signal for the 'scope.

Recorders (and suchlike) produce standing waves of air in the tube. The
concertina is a free reed instrument: air is blown past a tongue of
metal, which vibrates at a rate determined by its length and mass, in
such a way that the air going past is caused to vibrate too.
