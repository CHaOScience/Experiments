Risk Assessment: 

Risks +
1) burns +
2) fire becoming out of control

Minimise risk +
1) take care when handling, plan talk so don't have to move things
shortly after being extinguished +
2) Have specific places to burn things from where they will not spread

In case of emergency +
1) run exposed area under cold water for 15 minutes, find first aider +
2) Know fire escapes and procedures for building, know location of
nearest fire extinguishers and blankets

whoosh bottle +
The bottle must be made of polycarbonate (look for the mark ‘PC’ on the
base). Never use a glass bottle or a polycarbonate bottle that shows
signs of damage, frosting or cracking. +
• The bottle must be placed on a stable base. Only use a laboratory
bench if the distance between the top of the bottle and the ceiling is
greater than 2.5 m. The demonstration has been carried out successfully
with the bottle standing on a laboratory stool. However, in this
position, ensure that there is no risk of anyone leaning over the bottle
when its contents are ignited. +
• Check that there is nothing on the ceiling over the demonstration area
that could be set alight. +
• Never add pure oxygen to the bottle; use alcohol / air mixtures
only. +
• Wear eye protection. Use screen on audience side +
• After rolling the bottle, the vapour pressure inside may cause alcohol
to spray out when the stopper is removed. Take care to avoid spraying
yourself or the audience. Wipe off any alcohol that splashes on the
outside of the bottle. +
• Excess liquid alcohol must be removed from the bottle before the
mixture is ignited. If left in the bottle, burning liquid may melt the
plastic. If liquid does burn, restopper the bottle. +
• Only use the ignition procedure suggested. +
• Make sure that a fire blanket and fire extinguisher are readily
available.
