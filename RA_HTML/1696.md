Fruit Batteries and fuel cell construction
==========================================

Introduction
Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

Useful information
Kit List: 

Fruit, something to power, zinc rods, fork (steel rods)

Frequency of use: 

1

Explanation
Explanation: 

1. Connect the red wire on the LCD to a fork and the black wire to a zinc plate. Secure wires in place with adhesive tape.
2. Get another fork and zinc plate and connect them with the connection wire using adhesive tape.
3. Insert the forks and zinc plates into the lemon halves to activate the LCD watch movement as shown in the diagram. You will see your watch start blinking.

How does it work?
The forks act like the positive electrodes of a battery. They are plated with a metal which is less reactive than zinc. When the forks and zinc plates are inserted into the lemon, a chemical reaction takes place. Electrons (extremely small particles with negative charge) move from the zinc plates to the forks to form a current, thus activating the LCD watch. The lemon juice helps to conduct electricity. You can replace the lemon with a potato, a grapefruit or use soft drinks and see what effect this has.

Fun Facts
The development of the battery started in 1775 when a scientist called Alessandro Volta invented a machine that produced and stored static electricity by rubbing cat fur across a metal plate. A few years later, a doctor called Luigi Galvani noticed that dissected frogs' legs twitched when they were in contact with two different metals. Volta realized that the electricity came from the metals and began doing experiments with different types of metal. In 1800, he made the first ever battery which consisted of copper and zinc strips separated by a piece of paper soaked in salt water and dipped in diluted acid.

Extra points to get across... talk about circuits a bit, why does it all have to be connecting in a circuit, how does the electricity travel through the fruit!
