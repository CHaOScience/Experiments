Useful information
Kit List: 

- Rotating turntable
- Wire mesh
- BBQ lighter fuel.

Explanation
Explanation: 

Demo of a flame tornado - a small fire is made at the centre of a rotating mesh tube. The tube is rotated giving incoming air angular momentum, so it gets dragged in and makes a cool tornado effect.

Risk Assessment: 

A metal jar lid of BBQ lighter gel is burnt within a 1m high mesh cylinder that will rotate. As it rotates the flame gets drawn into a tornado, due to conservation of angular momentum.

**Risks:**
1. People, and especially fingers, could get burned if they get into the fire or touch hot surfaces.
2. The burning liquid could escape, and cause a fire/burns.

**Control Measures:**
1. Firstly this is *purely a demonstration* and should not be done interactively.
Audience should be kept at least 1.5m away.
The mesh cylinder is held onto the turntable quite well and acts as a shield to stop people touching it, and stops the flame getting out.
The demonstrator should be careful because the lid especially will be very hot when you come back to it.
2. Be very careful about where it is set up so there is nothing flammable nearby.
There should be a fire blanket close at hand.
BBQ lighter gel is used because it is quite viscous so will not fly out too easily
The jar lid is constrained so it remains central.
The turntable is constructed so the two halves don't come apart.

**In case of accident:**
1. Run burned areas under cold water for 10 mins or until it stops hurting - whichever is longer. Summon a first aider to assist the casualty.
2. Smother any flames with the fire blanket. If fire spreads call 999. In case of burns follow actions in (1).
