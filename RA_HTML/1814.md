Light Waves: Seeing is Believing, CBS Talk 2016
===============================================

<span class="submitted">Mon, 08/02/2016 - 12:52 — Andrei Ruskuc</span>
Useful information
Kit List: 

At least two different colours of laser pointer.
Diffraction gratings/CD DVD segments.
Ripple tank.
Shive wave machine (made from duct tape, skewers and weights).
Slinky.
Bubble wand (piece of wire bent into a loop) + bubble liquid.
Glass/perspex prism.
Polarising filters.
Torch.

Explanation
Explanation: 

I won't necessarily use all these demonstrations in the talk:

A) Polarisation: essentially a copy of the most basic part of the polarisation experiment, rotating two polarising filters.

B) Shive wave machine: two long duck tape strips stuck together with skewers sandwiched between at regular intervals. Weights are attached to the skewer ends. This is used as a wave model to demonstrate some basic characteristics.

C) Walking people model of refraction: use a line of volunteers walking at a regular pace to demonstrate what happens to a wavefront at an imaginary interface.

D) Refraction: shine a laser/white light through a prism to demonstrate refraction.

E) Use a slinky to demonstrate interference and standing waves.

F) Make bubbles/bubble films and relate colours being observed to standing waves in the film.

G) Ripple tank: used to demonstrate diffraction from a double slit or airy-type pattern formed if the tank is round.

H) Diffraction gratings: used to demonstrate that light diffraction is equivalent to what was observed in the ripple tank.

I) Get the audience to make a Mexican wave.

Risk Assessment
Date risk assesment last checked: 

<span class="date-display-single">Thu, 11/02/2016</span>

Risk assesment checked by: 

Andrei Ruskuc

Date risk assesment double checked: 

<span class="date-display-single">Thu, 11/02/2016</span>

Risk assesment double-checked by: 

Charis

Risk Assessment: 

A)
Risks:
Shining a torch in audience members' eyes.
Action to minimise:
Be aware of where torch is shining, don't aim at front few rows of audience.
If accident:
Might be dazzled, no permanent damage.

B)
Risks:
Sharp skewers hurting demonstrators/volunteers.
Weights falling off and falling on people.
Duck tape snapping under tension.
Wave machine hitting people whilst in motion.
Action to minimise:
Blunt skewer ends.
Ensure weights properly fixed on.
Test limit of duck tape strength prior to demonstration.
Control number and location of audience volunteers.
If accident:
Call first aider.

C)
Risks:
Volunteers tripping up.
Volunteers running/out of control.
Action to minimise:
Ensure area clear of trip hazards prior to talk starting.
Terminate demonstration if it gets out of control.
If accident:
Call first aider.

D)
Risks:
Prism breaking: sharp glass.
Eye injury from laser beam.
Action to minimise:
No volunteers and may want to place prism on a flat surface instead of holding it.
Use &lt;= class II lasers: blink reflex should protect eyes, make sure to shine away from audience.
If accident:
Ensure shards of prism are collected/contained before continuing.
Call first aider in case of injury.

E)
Risks:
Fingers getting caught/cut by metal slinky.
Slinky hitting people.
Action to minimise:
Tape slinky ends and ensure volunteer knows where/how to hold.
Ensure area used for slinky demonstration is clear of people.
If accident:
Call first aider in event of injury.

F)
Risks:
Audience members allergic to washing up liquid.
Slip hazard is spilt.
Sharp edges on bubble wand.
Action to minimise:
Check with audience/blow bubbles so that they don't land on audience.
Ensure container is on stable, elevated surface.
Check and tape any sharp edges prior to use.
If accident:
Call first aider in event of injury.
Mop up spillages promptly.

G)
Risks:
Slip hazard if water split.
Allergic reaction to any dyes used.
Cutting on shards of glass/perspex if tank breaks.
Action to minimise:
Ensure container is on stable, elevated base.
Check dyes prior to use, don't let audience members do this part.
Ensure container is on a stable surface and don't move it during talk.
If accident:
Mop up spillages promptly.
Call first aider in event of injury.
Clear up/contain glass shards.

H)
Risks:
Eye injury from laser.
Action to minimise:
Use &lt;= class II lasers: blink reflex should protect eyes, make sure to shine away from audience.
(test grating prior to talk to identify light paths)
If accident:
Call first aider in event of injury.

I)
Risks:
Audience members falling over.
Action to minimise:
Check space in front of seats in lecture theatre before talk.
If accident:
Call first aider in event of injury.
