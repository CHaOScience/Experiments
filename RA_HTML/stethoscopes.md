Useful information
Kit List: 

Stethoscope.
Anti-bacterial wipes (or tissues and disinfectant).

Packing Away: 

Pack stethoscopes carefully (usually in same blue box as stopwatches for 'Exercise and Heart Rate') so that they don't get damaged. Dispose of wipes sensibly.

Frequency of use: 

4

Use the 'heart rate and exercise' explanation too!

1. Do they know what it is?

2. Do they know what it's used for?
- Use it to listen to: Lungs, Heart, Bowel sounds, Bruits (noise due to turbulence in blood vessels for various reasons) in the following vessels:

1. Carotid
2. Femoral
3. Thyroid
4. Hepatic

3. What makes the sound?

Normal Lungs:
-Normally turbulent air going in and out of bronchi.
-Sounds different over bronchi/trachea and lung fields.
-Same noise, but in the lung fields it is heard through large amounts of other tissue and so is soften (I think it cuts out specific frequencies - high or low -but don't quote me on that).

Abnormal Lung (probably talk about Asthma as most kids now about it)

1) Bronchial breathing over lung fields.
Due to consolidation - solid debris in lungs with pneumonia- or fribrosis.
Means sound can't 'disperse' (I'm sure physicists would have better description).

2) Wheeze (can demonstrate this one).
Due to narrowing of the tubes.
Asthma wheeze, COPD gives polyphonic.
Tumour wheeze gives monophonic (because only blocks one tube).

b. Heart.
i. Have brief discussion about what heart does (see Heart Rate and Exercise or Heart Model explanations). Where is your heart? It is surprising how many children seem to think it's somewhere in their left shoulder!

ii. What makes noise in heart?
Valves - with older kids a discussion about why we have valves may be useful.

iii. Normal heart sounds.
- Lub-dub.

iv. Extra heart sounds:
Note, can have third and fourth heart sounds.
If you have both they make noise like train going over tracks - du-dub-du-dub.

v. Abnormal:
Due to turbulent flow through valves (make the noises).
Why do you get turbulent flow? - Valve doesn't fully open (stenosis) or Valve doesn't fully close (regurgitation)
