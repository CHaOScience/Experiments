Introduction
Public summary: 

Talk from CBS 2017

Talk from CBS 2017

Useful information
Kit List: 

The Kruskal's Count Experiment (lots of duplo or bigger bloacks)
A monopoly board
Grime Dice Experiment
Evolution Games PLUS Experiment
Large Fishtank(s)
Food Colouring
Wooden Spoons
A bath toy with a spinny thing on it

Explanation
Explanation: 

What is maths?
Volunteers for Kruskal's Count Experiment (3ish)
Get them to go around marking where they visit
Look for emergence of a steady state
Talk about how we can get a steady state in similar games
Monopoly
Simulation of Monopoly + Volunteers (3ish) simulating as before
Allows you to value how much a property is worth but only if you play long enough.
\[ How long is long enough?
Fish tanks + food colouring
mixing times
volunteer with spoon vs bath toy vs nothing
can talk about how changing the rules affects these times
simulate what it actually is for monop\]
\[Grime dice experiment\]
Run through of evolution games
simulation.

Risk Assessment: 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Modelling evolution via game theory.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>1. Children swallowing duplo or lego pieces<br />
<br />
2. Tossed coins flying off and hitting someone<br />
<br />
3. Many children trying to occupy the same card<br />
<br />
4. Cards are slippy if stood on<br />
5. People may trip on dice<br />
6. Slip hazard from spilt liquids.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>1. The duplo pieces should be sufficiently large to discourage swallowing. Do not use lego with very small children and keep a close eye on the box of lego.<br />
<br />
2. Check you can flip a coin without losing control of it, otherwise just spin it on the table. It's perfectly fine to let the children toss the coin themselves, but make sure they're capable of doing it safely with a trial flip first.<br />
3. Keep the number of children playing the game on the giant cards under a sensible limit, I would suggest 8 at a time, and discourage them from running or any form of pushing and shoving<br />
4. Discourage people from actually stepping on the cards.<br />
5. Keep dice on table<br />
6. Do not use necessarily large amounts of water/food colouring. Replace lids on nearby bottles when not in use. Mop up all spills promptly. Keep visitors away from area until cleaned up.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN CASE OF ACCIDENT</td>
<td>1. Call first aider if child swallows, if choking encourage child to cough.<br />
In all cases, call first aider in case of injury</td>
</tr>
