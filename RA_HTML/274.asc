Useful information

Kit List: 

Large clear plastic box with holes in lid +
Small magnifying viewing boxes +
Creepy crawlies - collected either by lifting up rocks etc or by using
traps made by sinking jars into the ground and covering with loose twigs
etc. and leaving overnight.

Packing Away: 

Return the creepy crawlies to a suitable habitat

Explanation

Explanation: 

We will collect these hopefully from a variety of habitats. It's
interesting to discuss how the insects are adapted/camouflaged to their
environments, and what the larvae might become.

Some examples of things that might be collected are:

*Insects* +
There are around a quarter of a million times more insects in the UK
than humans, and more than a million different kinds of insects
discovered on Earth (of these >20,000 species live in the UK). Beetles
are the biggest group within the insects. (Note: All bugs are insects,
but not all insects are bugs)

All insects have 6 legs and their bodies are divided into three main
parts; the head, thorax & abdomen.

The skeleton of an insect is on the outside of its body (and is called
an 'exoskeleton').

Insects breathe through little holes in their abdomen called spiracles
(they don't have lungs). [for older kids] This way of breathing puts a
size limit on the insects - they rely on diffussion (movement of
particles from areas where there are lots to where there are fewer).
When there was a higher concentration/more oxygen in the air (in the
Permian), insects could be bigger - with wingspans as wide as your
armspan! (As the greater difference in oxygen concentrations (between
the air outside and within the insect) allows diffusion over a longer
distance).

Examples of insects that you might collect are:

A few interesting facts are: +
- Froghoppers are best known for their nymph stage, which produces a
cover of frothy plant sap, "cuckoo spit" which hides the nymph from
predators, insulates them against the cold, UV radiation and keeps them
moist. +
- Crickets and grasshoppers both have jumping hind legs

*Woodlice* +
- Crustaceans with a rigid, segmented shell-like exoskeleton +
- 14 jointed limbs +
- Some woodlice can roll up into a sphere as a defensive mechanism +
- Live in moist places (e.g. under rocks and logs) because they breathe
through gills +
- They eat mostly dead plants (decomposers) +
- As woodlice grow they shed their exoskeleton in two stages, with the
back half first followed a few days later by the front

*Spiders* +
- Arthropods with 8 legs, they are not insects! (related to crabs!) +
- They don't have antennae but instead use hairs on their body and legs
to sense objects around them +
- Spiders are carnivorous but have small mouths so in order to eat they
inject poison into their victims which digests them +
- Some spiders spin webs to catch their food - flies get trapped in the
sticky strands of the web (made from silk produced by glands at the back
of the spider's body).

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Insects and other creepy crawlies (found by demonstrators)
in clear plastic display tanks. Observing their behaviour, eg. in moist
and dry conditions, and looking at them under a low magnification
microscope.

|RISKS |1. Stomach upsets if a child ingests an insect, or soil. Tetanus
risk if people with deep cuts touch soil. +
2. Electrical equipment - hot and risk of electrocution if faulty or
wet. +
3. Panic, especially if an insect gets loose. +
4. Itching or allergic reaction if someone is bitten by an insect.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Watch very young children to
ensure they do not put soil or insects in their mouths. Ensure that any
child who has touched soil or insects washes hands. Do not allow people
with cuts to handle soil - demonstrator to wear a plaster if (s)he has a
cut. +
2. Switch off microscope between uses if it starts to become hot. +
3. Ensure the insects are all kept in close range, and that children do
not open tray lids without supervision. +
4. Don't assign demonstrators with an allergy to insect bites to this
experiment. Encourage children to be gentle when handling insects.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. Reassure that there
will probably not be a problem, but to contact GP if any symptoms
ensue. +
2. Switch off equipment in the event of an electrical problem, clear
area, call first aider. If child burns themselves, keep affected area
under running cold water for 10 mins, call a first aider. +
3. Clear the area, get adults to help keep their children under control,
retrieve insects (call for help if necessary). +
4. Reassure that there probably won't be a problem, pull any visible
sting (get first aider), wash under a cold tap to soothe irritation.
