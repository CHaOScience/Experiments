Explanation
Explanation: 

A smoking (recently blown-out) match is dropped into a lemonade bottle containing a little water. The bottle is closed and then squeezed, held for a few moments, and released. Water condenses on the nucleation points provided by the smoke as the air pressure drops and temperature falls slightly.

Risk Assessment: 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Strike a match, extinguish it and drop it into a bottle containing a little water.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>1. Using matches - possibility of burns.<br />
2. If lit match is dropped on something flammable there is a small risk of fire.<br />
3. Slip hazard if any water is spilt.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>1. Ensure that matchbox is not available to be grabbed by children.<br />
Demonstrator to strike matches away from self but also to take care not to strike immediately towards visitors.<br />
Ensure match is no longer lit when dropped into bottle.<br />
Have a cup (or similar) of water to hand to take matches which might be lit and not used.<br />
2. Keep flammable materials away from matches. Have a fire extinguisher available.<br />
3. Have paper towels handy and dry any spills immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td>1. Run burns under cold water for at least 10 minutes.<br />
Contact a first aider.<br />
2. Fight fire if safe to do so.<br />
If fire gets out of control evacuate area and call 999.<br />
3. Call first aider in the event of injury.</td>
