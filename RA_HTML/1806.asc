side), 6 large, straight-sided plastic jars +
Fan, Large quantity of hole punchings, Sticky sticks, Plastic sheeting +
Straws of assorted sizes, flexible plastic tubing, bottles of 'nectar'

Packing Away: 

Don't throw anything out, we can use it again in future talks!

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",]
|=======================================================================
|*Experiment* |*Pollinator tongues* |*Nectar transmission* |*Wind
pollination*

|*Description* |Children with different length straws but same bottle,
showing how some pollinators are adapted to certain flower shapes |Have
child put on glove coated in velcro and reach into jar to get sweets,
get coated in soft "pollen" (velcro balls) |Using a fan to blow small
paper circles ("pollen") onto sticky surfaces (flowers)

|*Hazard* a|
Bottles of liquid

Straws cut to different lengths

 a|
Glove may be scratchy

Jars of sweets

 a|
Small bits of paper on floor could be slippery

Sticky flowers

|*Risks to audience* a|
Could splash/be dropped

Children may have allergies to sugary drink

Straws could have sharp ends

 a|
Being scratched

Getting hand stuck in jar

Allergy to contents

 a|
Could slip while leaving lecture theatre

Might leave other surfaces sticky

|*Risks to presenter* a|
Could get liquid spilt on electrical equipment

Could splash/be dropped

Straws could have sharp ends

 |None a|
Could slip while finishing lecture

Might stick to prop

|*Control measures* a|
Ensure children are in an area away from wires/electrical equipment when
drinking/holding the bottles of drinks

Have paper towel on hand to tidy any spills

Choose plain drink with no artifical colourings/flavourings to avoid
allergies

Check when cutting to leave smooth ends, discard potentially dangerous
ones

 a|
Ensure velcro doesn't go quite to edge of glove so no scratching when
putting on

Make sure jar could easily fit adult hand (aids with setup too), warn
volunteers of contents, choose sweets least likely to trigger allergies
(avoid artificial colourings)

 a|
Ensure paper blown into corner away from exit route. Lay out large sheet
under area blowing paper to speed up tidying up and avoid paper
everywhere

Use double sided tape, not glue, so stickyness cannot come off onto
other surfaces so easily. Find a lid to cover with until needed.

|=======================================================================

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
