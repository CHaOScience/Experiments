Introduction

Public summary: 

Build a model of the inner workings of your hand! Learn about how
muscles and tendons work together to control the movements of our
fingers, and have a model to take home, made of simple household
objects!

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

Build a small working model hand from card and straws!

Useful information

Kit List: 

Drinking straws +
Sellotape +
A4 card +
Printout attached below +
String +
Beads (optional)

Explanation

Explanation: 

\1. Cut out around the hand. +
2. Collect 5 pre-cut straws. +
3. Tape down a piece of string over the end of each finger. +
4. Thread a pre-cut straw onto each piece of string. +
5. Using the sticky tape secure the straw between each of the joints. +
6. Cut the straws a little way below the bottom of the fingers. +
7. Cut another 5 short segments of straw and tape these by the wrist of
your hand model. +
8. Thread each piece of string through a separate straw.

Hand Model works well with this; remember both RAs.

You can also demo with a "How science works" theme if you have no clue
about "how the hand" works. We study various models of how the hand
works of various complexities. The paper model we make is simple but has
more flaws than the more complicated Hand Model. You can get them to try
and recreate motions on the two models and their actual hand and lok for
ligaments moving.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Small model of tendons in hand, using card, straws and
string

|RISKS |Small parts could be swallowed e.g. beads, or small parts of
straw +
 +
Use of Scissors +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Ideally straws are pre-cut. Use of beads (optional) to be monitored
carefully

Younger children should be accompanied by an adult. CHaOS volunteers to
oversee carefully

Ensure kids are behaving sensibly at all times

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
event of injury
