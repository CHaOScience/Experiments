Introduction

Public summary: 

Viruses are tiny particles that infect animals and plants - causing
infections like chicken pox. Come and have a look at our cuddly viruses
and hear more about what they do!

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Cuddly viruses and virus models to demonstrate. This experiment can be
combined with the bacteria and parasites boxes too – all were new for
the 2011 Summer Roadshow so are very open to suggestions for
improvement!

Tips for demonstrating: +
- Lay out the cuddly viruses on the table and let children pick them up
and ask you what they are +
- Ask questions to see what the children know about viruses and start
from there! +
- If it's busy it might be easier to keep most of the viruses in the box
and bring them out one at a time to help control questions +
- You can use the plastic virus model to give a more realistic
representation to your group (better for older children) +
- There is some more information about each cuddly virus on the attached
labels in the box

~~~~~~~~~~~

Viruses can be as simple as DNA or RNA in a protein coat. Viruses use
the host cell’s machinery to make lots of new virus particles (virions).
Often viruses are released from cells by making them burst (lysis).
Others gradually bud off from the cell, taking some membrane with them
and the cell survives (eg. HIV), giving a continuous release of virus
particles. Viruses can’t survive for very long outside of cells so new
virions quickly find a new cell to infect. Viruses are also very
‘clever’ as they have lots of strategies to subvert the host cell
function eg. by stimulating the host cell to divide so there is enough
replicative machinery in the host cell to make lots of virus.

*HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)*: Retrovirus (RNA genome copies
itself into DNA, using viral reverse transcriptase. The DNA integrates
into the host chromosome and new viral genomes are produced by host
transcription/translation machinery) +
Can be spread via some bodily fluids and blood. Lives in white blood
cells (CD4+ helper T cells) and eventually kills them, which means the
immune system cannot function properly. People where HIV has killed too
many white blood cells have AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome),
and this means that they can become very ill or even die from diseases
that would not harm a healthy person (opportunistic infections – a big
killer is tuberculosis caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ – cuddly
bug in the bacteria box).

*Common Cold (Rhinovirus)*: positive sense RNA +
Spreads easily from infected people when they sneeze or contaminate
surfaces. The virus is very happy at the temperature and conditions in
the human nose which is where they initially infect. There are lots of
different types of rhinovirus whose protein coats all look different to
the immune system, which is why we don’t get become immune to the common
cold.

*Measles (Morbillivirus)*: negative sense RNA virus +
Usually spread by breathing in virus from droplets in the atmosphere.
Causes a fever, rash and red eyes. Most people will have been vaccinated
against this with the MMR jab, which mostly eradicated measles from the
UK. However since the scare about the MMR jab (spuriously linked to
autism), the disease has been cropping up in affluent areas of London!
(Vaccine scares can destroy herd immunity, the protection the population
has when enough people are vaccinated and the virus cannot find enough
hosts to spread to.)

*Kissing Disease (Epstein-Barr Virus)*: DNA virus +
Most of you will have this virus right now. It is usually spread via
saliva, causing a mild fever in the majority of the population in early
childhood. (Lots of people have asked me why this is and the answer is
we don’t really know – scientists think it might be something to do with
how the immune response develops over childhood.) However some people
who don’t get the virus in early life might get it when they come into
contact with other people’s saliva in their teenage years - they then
get Glandular Fever. An interesting thing about the virus is that you
never really get rid of it; some of its DNA forms little circles in the
nucleus of the white blood cells it infects, and it can remain dormant
(latent infection) for a long time (occasionally getting out into saliva
but not making you ill). The virus that causes chicken pox can do this
in nerve cells.

*Influenza*: Negative sense RNA virus +
Spread by breathing in virus particles (Respiratory tract). Causes
symptoms including fever, headache, cough, muscle aches and less
commonly vomiting and diarrhoea. It can be vaccinated against, however
it is able to sometimes change the way it appears to the immune system
in the body (by mutating its genome which is a random process). This
means flu vaccines keep having to be updated to protect people against
the new variations of the virus. This, and the fact that influenza virus
also infects birds, is the reason why it would not be possible to
eradicate influenza. Could compare this to viruses like smallpox and
polio which have or have nearly been eradicated because they have more
stable genomes and no animal reservoir.

*Rabies*: Negative sense RNA virus +
Enters via skin and exits via saliva - spread through being bitten by an
infected animal (usually dog). Results in death by killing brain cells
in the cerebellum. The virus travels to the brain from the bite site up
the nerves and it progresses slowly, so it is possible to stop the
progression of the disease by vaccinating after being bitten.

*Ebola*: Negative sense RNA virus +
Spreads by direct contact. This virus has a high fatality rate of up to
90% (but closer to 40% in the most recent outbreak). It causes symptoms
including fever, muscle aches, skin rash, vomiting + diarrhoea,
weakness, bleeding from nose, mouth etc. The virus can infect many cell
types and it spreads within the body through the circulatory system. It
causes such severe disease because it causes clotting within the blood
vessels, bleeding inside the body (haemorrhage) leading to a drop in
blood pressure and multi-organ failure. It is also so severe because it
originated in a different animal to humans - the fruit bat - and
transmitted to humans relatively recently. This is in contrast to
viruses such as the common cold which have been in human populations for
a long period of our evolution meaning we have adapted to survive it.

*Winter Vomiting Disease (Norovirus)*: Positive sense RNA virus +
Very common in the UK and very contagious. Causes vomiting and
diarrhoea. Spread can be prevented by washing hands regularly.

*Polio*: Positive sense RNA virus +
See "Polio, vaccination and disease eradication" experiment

*Chicken Pox*: Double stranded DNA virus +
Otherwise known as Varicella-Zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus
family. Highly contagious; Spread through direct contact, coughing and
sneezing, and causes red spots on the skin all over the body. Causes
mild symptoms if caught when young, but causes Shingles in adults which
is more serious. After initial infection, the virus goes dormant
(latent) in the nervous system, and later in life it might reactivate to
cause shingles.

*T4 (T4-Bacteriophage)*: +
Bacteriophage are viruses but they do not infect humans – they infect
bacteria. One day this might be useful to us for treating bacterial
infections (‘phage therapy’) where you can infect specific bacterial
cells with genes that kill them/stop them reproducing.
