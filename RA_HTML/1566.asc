Overview
~~~~~~~~

This is a very exciting talk. Hopefully. Probably. Well, maybe.
Possibly. Potentially. Anyway, this is all about trying to make
crystallography appear fun, exciting, and wonderful. Thus this is what
this talk is about. It is essentially a nice meander through how to do
X-ray crystallography...

In the beginning

So then – welcome everyone, say your name, and thank the demonstrators
for helping you throughout the talk. So then, let us begin.

This talk is all about three words, and these are the only things I
would like you to remember. Protein X-ray crystallography. I am fully
expecting you to not have any clue what they are. I am going to take
each word, and tell you all about it, as it is one of the most amazing
and incredible part of science

Proteins

Before I begin – let us first consider this. ~What do you find in a
city? Anyone – hands up. Excellent. No you don’t find a UFO in a city
normally, but nice try. Yes. Here are a list of examples – buildings,
taxis, police cars, police stations, etc… Now let us take two examples –
a taxi and a police station – what do you find in a taxi? (Ask around).
Talk about steering wheel, brake, boot etc… Then what do you find in a
police station (Again ask around)? Smoke detector, prison cells, doors
etc…

So your body is just like this city. It has a huge number of things in
it – and these are called cells – just like the taxis and the buildings.
Now inside your cells there are a huge number of things that do stuff.
Like the smoke detector – and these are proteins. They are very very
small, but we want to know what they look like. Take a picture of the
insides of a smoke detector – get to know what it looks like.

Just trying to take a photo. That is all.

Leads on to getting everyone to imagine they are proteins. I want to
take a picture of you on this web camera – I want everyone to be as
still as possible – 3,2,1,cheese. – What did you all do – you all froze
in place – which is great because the web camera had a very slow shutter
speed – it took in light for a whole 2/3 seconds. Now let us do it again
– keep completely still, but this time, I want everyone to do jazz
hands. Picture. Look – the hands are really blurred. In fact protein,
when left in water, like it normally is inside you, is like you running
around really, really fast all over the room, and when we take a picture
of it using this technique, leads to a big blur. We want to freeze it in
place, and this leads to us crystallising it.

What are crystals? See these beautiful examples above – which is what
you automatically think of. Very beautiful. So what exactly are they?
Repeat of a very small repeating unit in a very ordered way. It is a
small unit repeating in a very ordered way.

So then, how do we build a crystal – it is just a repeat of lots of
small building blocks. I want one brave volunteer to come down and build
a tower from these wooden blocks – so then these blocks represent one
unit of a crystal, and in a crystal they just repeat and repeat. So
then, with these nice large blocks, build a tower. Go. Look how nice
that is – a perfect tower. Give a huge round of applause.

Now then, it is time to get a demonstrator to build a tower as well –
years of university training for this one moment. OK, I want you to
build a tower out of (mass unveiling) these rubber ducks. Go. Watch him
fail. Some things crystallise a lot easier than other things. Now we can
add things to the solution to help them crystallise. For example, if we
put the rubber ducks into these boxes, then they can now be stacked, and
so now crystallise. This is what we do to proteins – they are
essentially rubber ducks, and we add things to help them crystallise.

Why do we want to get them to crystallise – it freezes them in place.
Right – everybody one hand with their neighbour – now try to do jazz
hands without letting go. It is a lot more difficult, isn’t it? Now
imagine you were joined together with a huge number of other people.
Very difficult to do jazz hands. Thus we get a crystal which freezes
them – so persuades them to stand still

How do we get a nice crystal? The important thing about building a
crystal is that it takes time. Like writing this talk. In order for it
to be nicely ordered. Imagine packing away to go on holiday. If you do
it in two minutes – suitcase is a huge mess, whereas if you spend all
day doing it, it is far more likely to be neat and nicely ordered – well
hopefully…

Why does ordering the crystal matter – well, if I go over here to this
OHP – I can explain why. Switch on an OHP. Look at this – it looks like
a fuzzy circle doesn’t it. This is because all of these OHP sheets are
disordered. If I now order them all – hey presto, get a triangle.
Therefore having a nice ordered structure is important. If you get a
horrible mess, cannot tell much from it.

So finally I come to the X-Ray Part of this talk… What is an X-Ray?
Well, it is a special type of light, actually – you all know what light
is – it can be thought of as a wave. However, there are other types of
light as well, ranging from radio waves, to microwaves – warms up your
food. It is what controls your TV (IR), and what is harmful from the
sun. X-Rays, though are the most common place.

They are all a wave – possibly use a slinky, but no RA yet.

What is an X-ray – well you all know the hospital use – look at bones.
Here we are looking at what is absorbed, and what isn’t. However, in
protein X-Ray crystallography, we are interested in a very different
thing – what is diffracted. Now to explain what happens we have this
ripple tank here, happily chugging along – bringin up and down a
plunger. Up, down, up down – look at the waves. This is an awesome model
for light – it too is a wave that goes up and down. Now, do you see the
pattern? What do you think happens when I put a block in it. – Get a
very different picture now – the waves spread out from this point – get
a pattern – called a diffraction pattern actually. Now look how it
changes if I open up the second hole – get a very different pattern now.
Same happens here with light.

Now I see some not sure faces in the audience – so I will now
demonstrate this with light – I have in my hand a tiny grid – not as
tiny as the proteins, but still really tiny, and I have two lasers – a
red one and a green one. I am now going to shine it against the wall –
see one single beam. Now if I put an EM grid in front of it – what
happens? Wow – get a diffraction pattern – isn’t that exciting – it is
just a series of dots though. Can we tell what this actually looks like
in real life though – the answer is yes we can – use a lens – just like
in a camera – this will then bring back our image of the light shining
through the holes in this metal grid.

Now the question is – why don’t we just shine a laser on to the crystal
– the answer is that it doesn’t quite work – look here – let me now
change this to a green laser (was red) – so this is moving in the
spectrum towards X-rays – notice how all the dots change position – how
far apart the dots are depend both on how big the grid is, and on the
light. Proteins are really, really close together, so we have to use
X-rays.

Next question then – we use X-rays, why can we not use a lens like in a
camera to get a pretty picture of the protein – answer – because there
is no lens good enough. However we can do it mathematically – if we knew
everything from these dots – we could work it out.

Now to get from these dots to nice pretty picture of a protein still
takes a lot of work, and a lot of PhD students and software, but we will
ignore that for now. We get a nice pretty picture of a protein, such as
this one – hoorah. Now this is a very special protein called haemoglobin
– what it does is that it carries oxygen round the entire body – like a
taxi service. We get a nice picture, which looks like this.

However, there is a condition in which the protein is deformed – sickle
cell anaemia – it is like having a taxi where you have forgotten to put
in the back seats, so it carries oxygen less well. Totally changes the
shape of a red blood cell – e.g. if you look at the crystal shown below,
you get the following fluffy red blood cells- you can have a look on the
way out

Finally, I am going to grow a crystal on the way out. Most crystals take
a very long time to grow. However, occasionally, you can get very rapid
crystallisation. Here is a solution of sodium acetate solution (brought
in by demonstrator from next door). It is currently liquid – put it
under the camera. Now if I add this small crystal – so as to add as a
starting point for the tower of crystallisation – look it becomes a full
crystal.

Thank you for listening – thank you for our funding bodies – and thank
you to our demonstrators. On your way out – you can look at these
crystals or these cells. Hope you have a pleasant day!
