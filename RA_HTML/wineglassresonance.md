Useful information
Kit List: 

Belongs to the IoP (I think)

Explanation
Explanation: 

Causing a wine glass to resonate using sound, so that you can see deformation using a strobe light, and possibly break it.

Risk Assessment: 

Making a wine glass resonate using sound, for physics event 26/3/200

RISKS
1- Very High volumes are required to break the wineglass
2- If a wineglass breaks it will produce sharp shards.
3- The shards may not have been fully cleaned up last time.
4- The sound minimising box is very heavy and awkward
5- Are using a strobe light, that may have negative effects on you or visitors. Strobe effects are known to cause headaches and fainting in susceptible individuals and may trigger certain types of epilepsy.

CONTROL MEASURES
1- The experiment is done in a double layered sound minimising box. TURN OFF THE AMPLIFIER BEFORE OPENING
2- be careful inside the box, use gloves if available, and sensible for dealing with a broken glass.
3- Be aware of this, don't run your finger around the inside of the box.
4- Don't lift it if you are not comfortable doing so.
5- Keep the frequency of the strobe above 100Hz, this is well above the most dangerous range. (According to the epilepsy foundation, "Generally, flashing lights most likely to trigger seizures are between the frequency of 5 to 30 flashes per second (Hertz)." From [http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/answerplace/Medical/seizures/precipita...](http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/answerplace/Medical/seizures/precipitants/photosensitivity/photosensitivity.cfm "http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/answerplace/Medical/seizures/precipitants/photosensitivity/photosensitivity.cfm") <span class="print-footnote">\[1\]</span> on 23/3/07.)
The strobe in use seems to default to (25Hz?), so DEMONSTRATOR SHOULD ENSURE BEFORE STARTING THAT IT IS SET TO OVER 100 Hz BEFORE EACH USE.

IN CASE OF INCIDENT
1- If loss of hearing is suspected seek medical attention.
2,3,4- In case of injury see a first aider.
5- Turn off strobe, see a first aider.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk assessment.
