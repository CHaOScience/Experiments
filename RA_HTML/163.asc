Useful information

Kit List: 

Bubble mixture +
Frames with which to make bubbles. +
Large container.

Packing Away: 

Wash out container +
Rinse and dry frames.

Explanation

Explanation: 

*** OVERVIEW ****

We make giant soap bubbles and look at how they behave in different
shaped frames.

Possible activities: +
Make bubbles

Other things to talk about: +
Surface tension.

*** BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION ***

Surface tension. This determines the shape of bubbles, causing them to
form spheres. When multiple bubbles meet, the shape is again determined
by surface tension and not more than 4 bubbles can meet at a point.

*** OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ***

The equilibrium between air pressure and surface tension. +
The thickness of the film is the same for all bubbles. +
Colours in bubbles caused by diffraction.

*** SCIENCE BACKGROUND FOR DEMONSTRATORS ***

The bubble mixture we have used before is: +
10 parts Cheap washing up liquid +
1 part Glycerine/-ol to +
100 parts (triply distilled? ) water

You use cheap washing up liquid as there is less random stuff in it
which annoys the detergent.

The glycerine increases the viscosity of the liquid, so it runs through
the soap film slower, so the film is more stable.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Blowing giant soap bubbles, and looking at how detergent
films behave.

|RISKS |# 1. Bubble mixture getting into eyes or being ingested +
# 2. Slip hazard +
# 3. Wire frames being pointy

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |# 1. Try to keep children under
control. If the mixture gets into an eye, demonstrator must call a first
aider and may perform an eye wash if trained and confident to do so. +
# 2. Do it outside where surfaces are designed to be wet (e.g. grass),
try to keep the spillage under control, stop the experiment and clear it
up if necessary. +
# 3. Design the wire frames so all ends are tucked in well. Discourage
people from waving the frames around wildly.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |# 1.Call first aider in
case of injury. +
# 2.Call first aider in case of injury, clear up excess spillage. +
# 3.Call first aider in case of injury.
