Introduction

Public summary: 

Turning a hexaflexagon inside out almost seems like magic. Find out what
kind of cool patterns emerge as you do it, and then learn the theory of
groups hidden inside it.

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Useful information

Kit List: 

Pre-printed Hexaflexagon templates (preferably prefolded as well) as
well as a guide on how to fold them +
Scissors +
Glue +
Pens to colour them and stickers.

Explanation

Explanation: 

Obviously, all Vihart's videos on Hexaflexagons are compulsory watching:

At first you can treat it more as a logic puzzle; they need to figure
out how to take a hexaflexagon and turn it inside out by only folding it
(emphasise that you're only allowed to fold- you can do it by just
'pulling' the inside face through, but this is cheating and really
damages the paper hexaflexagons). This (or other guides on the internet)
show you how to do it correctly:

[2] +
Once they've mastered that (get them to do it a few times), then ask
them if they can do the opposite flex. See, there are 2 types of flexes,
the one in the guide (the down flex) and the similar up flex. You do
this by getting the other three corners and lifting them up to meet at
the top, then opening out the bottom. Try to make sure they don't flip
over the hexaflexagon as they do this. One way to encourage them to find
the up flex themselves and not flip it over is to start the entire group
off with their hexaflexagons with the same colours on the top and bottom
as each other. Say green on top, pink on the bottom. Then ask them to,
in one move, get pink on top and yellow on the bottom. Once they have up
and down, if you still have there attention then you can get them to
figure out equations: up up up= back to the start. flip up flip= down
(this is a good one). If they're too young for that (or get confused
with how many flips they've done- this happens a lot), move them onto
the patterns.

A really fun one to get them to solve is, draw a sad face on a
hexaflexagon (this has to be done in a particular way but there should
be an example in the box). Ask them to figure out how to make it smile.
This will illustrate to them that when you do one flex, the face that's
still showing from before is now actually inverted. If you have time at
the end give them each a blank hexaflexagon and get them to decorate it
with this in mind- lines from the centre out and circles in the middle
etc look really cool when flexed. There should also be one with pictures
on it like a snake and a planet etc. Show them these for them to get
some ideas for designing their own.

For more capable people, you can start talking to them about equations
and even solving equations. For example, if any equation like (up flip
up up) x (down down flip)=flip you can solve this. But to work up to
this, get them used to the idea that ax=b means x=a^-1 b not x=ba^-1.
Explain it as, order matters. Putting an action on the left means you do
it last, where as putting it on the right means do it first.

The group here has 6 elements, and is in fact D_3 (or some people call
it D_6). For very advance and capable students, show them that the
hexaflexagon group is actually isomorphic to D_3 by using the triangle
in the box. Ask them which elements get identified and how many rules
they need to show to show that's true.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |To play with hexaflexagon and understand their properties,
and to make some with cool patterns.

|RISKS |1. Risk the children will grab scissors. +
 +
2. Risk that children will take and possibly eat glue. +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Make sure you cut out
hexaflexagons before the kids arrive. If you need to have scissors on
the table, have the safety scissors. +
 +
2. Put the glue behind you (in the box) after you use it each time. +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. If there is any
cuts, call a first aider +
 +
2. Glue isn't toxic, however, do alert parents immediately and call a
first aider if necessary. +
