Explanation

Explanation: 

This is a first draft of an explanation, so it’s liable to evolve over
time. Ideas for visual aids to explain immunity, vaccination etc. would
also be gratefully received. +
There are a few key concepts you can talk about with polio, depending on
how keen the children are and their level of understanding: +
• The virology of poliovirus; how it replicates etc. +
• How poliovirus causes disease +
• Vaccination +
• Disease eradication

*The Virology* +
This is quite hard to explain without getting bogged down in detail. For
most children, I’d restrict it to explaining that polio is a virus, so
it needs to hijack our cells to make more of itself. +
Polio is a virus which can cause a disease called poliomyelitis. Viruses
are incredibly small particles (virions) containing the genetic
instructions needed to make more virions. To infect a cell, the virus
sticks to the cell surface then injects its RNA into the cell (if we’re
being precise, the whole virion is internalised by receptor-mediated
endocytosis before the genome enters the cytoplasm, but we can probably
skip this). +
The host cell is then ‘tricked’ into producing thousands of new virions;
the RNA has the instructions to make the viral proteins and also acts as
a template to produce more genomes. Eventually, the cell bursts,
releasing up to 10,000 new virions into its environment, ready to infect
more cells.

*How polio causes disease* +
Polio spreads by the faeco-oral route; ie poo contaminating drinking
water. That’s why it’s often seen in areas with poor sanitation. It’s
also the reason that young children are more likely to get infected,
since they tend to have lower standards of hygiene! +
The vast majority of people infected get a fairly harmless infection in
the gut or get vague ‘flu-like’ symptoms. +
Polio becomes a problem if it infects cells called motor neurones in our
spinal cord. We need these cells to control our muscles, so if lots of
them are killed then the muscles become paralysed. The resulting disease
is paralytic poliomyelitis, which is what most people think of when you
mention polio. Interestingly, infecting the cells in the central nervous
system does not help the virus transmit to other hosts. +
What effects can paralysis have? It depends on where is affected.
Obviously, if the legs are affected the patient won’t be able to walk.
Even worse is bulbar poliomyelitis, where the muscles we use to breath
can become paralysed. +
There isn’t a cure for polio. All we can do is support the patient to
keep them alive. If their breathing muscles become paralysed then they
need mechanical ventilation, meaning that a machine is used to do the
work for them. Famously, in the 1950s this took the form of negative
pressure ventilation, aka the iron lung

*Vaccination* +
Polio affected thousands of people in the Western world in the 1950s.
But ask the children how many people they’ve met who’ve had polio. The
answer should (hopefully!) be none. Why? Because there’s a vaccine to
prevent it! +
Normally our bodies fight infections using our immune systems. Our
immune system ‘learns’ how to fight an infection when it’s exposed to
the pathogen, so it fights it more effectively the second time around.
That’s why we normally only get chickenpox once, even though it’s a
really infectious disease. Vaccines are a way to teach our immune system
to fight a disease. +
Different vaccines work in different ways; some use a dead pathogen or
part of a pathogen, while others use a live one that’s been deliberately
weakened so that it’s no longer able to cause disease, but still similar
enough to the dangerous one that our immune system learns to fight that
one too. +
In the case of polio, there are actually vaccines that work both ways;
the live vaccine is more ‘realistic’ so it produces more effective
immunity, but there’s a risk that the ‘safe’ strain can mutate back into
a ‘dangerous’ one. In the UK we use the dead vaccine, since you’re
highly unlikely to be exposed to polio anyway, but in areas where polio
is still common we use the live one, since the benefit outweighs the
risk.

*Disease eradication* +
The polio vaccine is important because it might be possible one day to
use it to eradicate polio completely. In fact, we’re tantalisingly close
to doing so! +
Have they heard of any other diseases that have been completely
eradicated? There’s only one human disease: smallpox. For the vets,
there’s also rinderpest, which I’m informed infected cows… +
Polio has certain special features which are needed for a disease to be
eradicated: +
• It doesn’t change so much over time that the vaccine stops working.
Contrast with flu, where we need a new vaccine very year, and even that
isn’t guaranteed to work! +
• It doesn’t infect animals. Animal viruses which also infect humans are
basically impossible to eradicate, since it just needs one person to be
infected by an animal and we’re back to square one. Sadly, this applies
in the case of Ebola. +
We’ve come incredibly close to eradicating polio in recent years, and
it’s now largely confined to Nigeria, tribal regions of Pakistan and
Afghanistan. However, these areas are all highly politically unstable
and health workers have been targeted by violence, so it remains to be
seen whether the final push will be successful.
