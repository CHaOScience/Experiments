Explanation
Explanation: 

NB: This experiment is included as an historical reference, and is unlikely to be resurrected in the form described here due to it's excessive malodorous substance content.

Different functional groups have different characteristic smells, e.g. esters smell sweet and fruity, amines smell of rotting meat. We have a range of smelly chemicals and try to get the kids to group them according to smell and hence functional group. We also have models of all the chemicals so try to get the kids to group these according to shape (of functional group) and then make the connection between shape and smell.

<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><p>Public smell a range of volatile, smelly chemicals. Try to group chemicals by smell. Look at models and group by shape. Make connection between shape and smell.</p></td>

<td>RISKS</td>
<td><p>1. Public contact with chemicals<br />
2. Bottle containing chemical could break<br />
3. Demonstrator contact with chemicals when preparing experiment<br />

5. Storage and transport of chemicals</p>
<p>COSHH: risks associated with each chemical used</p>
<p>Ethanol - highly flammable<br />
1-Butanol - flammable; harmful if swallowed; irritating to respiratory system and skin; risk of serious damage to eyes; vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness<br />
1-Hexanol - harmful if swallowed<br />
1-Octanol - none<br />

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td><p>1. Only very small amount (one drop) of chemical used</p>
<p>Permeable membrane lid on bottle ensures only very small amount of chemical released</p>
<p>Lids taped on to bottles so that they cannot easily be removed</p>
<p>Bottles are distinctive and look like they come from a laboratory, so noticeably should not be carried off by child</p>
<p>Bottles clearly labelled with orange hazard labels (flammable, harmful, corrosive) and numbered so that demonstrator is immediately aware if one is missing</p>
<p>Demonstrator keeps control of all bottles at all time: Do not allow any of them out of your sight, do not allow public to remove lids</p>
<p>If necessary (e.g. particularly busy event) bottles attached to table (or other heavy difficult to move oject) via string so that they cannot be physically removed</p>
<p>Experiment carried out in well ventillated area</p>
<p>2. Chemicals contained in sturdy glass bottles which should not break when<br />
dropped etc</p>
<p>3. When preparing experiment (pipetting chemicals into bottles) wear gloves<br />
and eye protection and perform in very well ventilated area, ideally fume<br />
hood, but otherwise outside. Pipettes and contaminated gloves should be<br />
left in well ventilated area until smell has subsided and then disposed of<br />
appropriately.</p>
<p>4. Models not to be given to children under age of 7 because of small parts<br />
which represent choking hazard</p>
<p>5. Chemicals stored and transported in locked metal box.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td><p>If bottle breaks: evacuate area if neccessary because of smell, clear up broken glass and remove to well ventilated area e.g. outside until smell has subsided then dispose of appropriately.</p>
<p>In case of chemical contact with eyes, rinse immediately with eye wash if trained and confident to do so. Call first aider and seek medical advice.</p>
<p>In case of accident or if you feel unwell seek medical advice immediately.</p>
<p>If chemical swallowed seek medical advice immediately and show container/label.</p></td>
