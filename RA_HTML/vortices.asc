Useful information

Kit List: 

Folding cabinet with transparent front, including lighting. +
Smoke ring cannon (a bucket on legs) +
Power supply for the smoke generator +
(optional) A tank of water, and something to use as a paddle +
(optional) A washing-up bowl with a hole in it +
NB: This experiment has been retired for a while due to difficulties in
making an effective supply of smoke.

Explanation

Explanation: 

** OVERVIEW ***

This experiment exhibits vortices, in particular in smoke rings.

The bowl can be filled with water; a simple vortex forms in it as it
empties.

The paddle, moved through the water, sheds vortices from its sides.

The smoke ring cannon makes smoke rings when tapped on the base. These
are easily viewed in the cabinet.

*** BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION ***

This experiment is about smoke rings, but, to understand why they
happen, it's best to start with something simple, like water emptying
from a bath. Have you ever noticed what water does when it goes down a
plughole? Does it just go straight down? With any luck, your audience
will have already noticed that it doesn't, but it's still useful to show
them a simple vortex in action using the bowl with a hole in. It's also
possible to make a vortex without draining the water away: to do this,
persuade someone to drag a paddle through a tank of water. Can you see
the little whirlpools falling off the sides? They form because the
paddle speeds up the bit of water next to it, so that it's going faster
than the bit of water next to that, making the water twist.

So far the cores of our vortices (whirlpools) have been roughly straight
lines. It's possible to make a vortex the core of which bends back on
itself in a circle. You can spin your hand in the air at this point -
this demonstrates how awkward the thing is to describe without a real
example! Fortunately, we have one - since air is a fluid, like water, we
can make a ring of vortex in it. If we use smoke, we'll even be able to
see it. This is what the smoke machine is for. When you tap the base,
some smoke gets pushed out of the hole at the top. The sides of the hole
in the bucket work like the paddle did in the tank, slowing down the
smokey air near the sides more than that in the middle, and making a
twisting movement all of the way round. This makes a ring of vortex -
can you see how it's rotating?

*** OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ***

Pipe smokers can make smoke rings, as can volcanos!

vortices in air occur in weather systems. Tornados are a particularly
vivid example, but there are big, slow vortices around the size of
countries sitting around all of the time, determining the direction of
the wind.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Looking at vortices in shallow water tanks and plugholes,
and lemonade bottles. Also, creating smoke rings.

|RISKS a|
1. Spilt water could be a slip hazard

2. Spilt water could be dangerous if there is electrical equipment
nearby

3. Canned smoke is flammable.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Clear up spills promptly. If pouring water into the bowl with a hole
in the bottom, use another bowl to catch the water to minimise spillage.

2. Clear up spills promptly. Isolate electrical equipment from the
mains +
if it may have been affected.

3. Ensure it's kept away from naked flames, do not allow the build up of
too much smoke in an unventilated area (eg the darkroom tent!).

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1. Call first aider in case of injury.

2. Switch off power supply to any equipment causing injury, and call
first aider.

3. Follow standard procedures for fire (see venue RA). Evacuate area,
use fire extinguisher only if safe to do so, call fire brigade.

This experiment is sometimes run in a darkroom, see separate risk
assessment.
