Eclipses, Exoplanets and Phases of the Moon
===========================================

<span class="submitted">Wed, 11/02/2015 - 12:31 — zephyrost</span>
Explanation
Explanation: 

Demonstrates why we see the different phases of the moon, introduces the concept of eclipses and planets as reflective surfaces and extends this to different ways to detect exoplanets.

Risk Assessment: 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Understanding the phases of the moon, eclipses and how we can use this to detect exoplanets. In development but will contain a combination of balls to represent planets, and probably torches to represent stars and far off planets. May contain darkened glasses to reduce the effect of ambient light.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>1. Trip hazard if balls are dropped or left to roll about<br />
<br />
2. Light shining in the eyes<br />
<br />
3. Disorientation wearing or taking off dark glasses<br />
<br />
4. After months of no use, batteries dying inside torches, and possibly leaking</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>1. Balls to be kept int box between uses. Care taken that children do not drop or bounce balls. Children should be instructed to walk not run at all times in the experiment.<br />
<br />
2. Torches used will not be excessively bright, and children will only be encouraged to look at them for brief periods.<br />
<br />
3. Ensure surrounding area is clear so they cannot stumble over anything. Check that children are still relatively able to see when wearing the glasses. Don't leave them on for extended periods and be aware it may take a little while for eyes to readjust when taking them on and off.<br />
4. Check Batteries inside torches at the start of each day. Ensure no obvious signs of damage</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td>If children become disorientated make sure they stand still and/or sit down until they have regained their composure.<br />
Call first aider in event of injury</td>
</tr>
