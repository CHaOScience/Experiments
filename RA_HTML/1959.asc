Risk Assessment: 

*Experiment*

*Geological TimeLine Scarf*

*Limestone Composition*

*Fossils and Replica Dinosaur Bones*

*Plushy Visual Aids*

*Scale Model of the Solar System*

*Audience Half-Life Experiment*

*Description*

A ~30m scarf, colour-coded with each geological period. +
To covey sheer size of geological time, how long humans have existed for
and dinosaurs. +
Audience volunteers unroll the scarf, stopping at key stages in
geological history.

Dissolving Limestone and collecting the gas produced in limewater. +
Observation of CO2 released.

For the use of demonstrator. Placed under the projector to display to
the audience.

Use of plushie dinosaurs and other soft “creatures” as a visual aid

To display relative distance from Earth to the asteroid belt. Involves
volunteers moving around the lecture room and props (sports balls to
scale)

Audience Members Stand Up / Wave Hands in Air and instructed to sit down
at different intervals to represent radioactive decay

*Hazard*

Tripping hazard

Strangulation Hazard

Glass Breaking

Vinegar / weak acid spray is irritant

Spill hazard – electrical

Spill hazard – chemical

Swallowing hazard

Dropping of fossils on feet

Falling on the floor and being a tripping hazard.

Tripping or falling whilst moving around the lecture theatre

Balls rolling and becoming a trip hazard

Swallowing of small marble sized balls

Young children falling over from standing on chairs

*Action To Be Taken To Minimise Risks*

Keep scarf off the floor to prevent tripping

Encourage volunteers not to unwind scarf too fast

Ensure scarf unwinding does not occur where there are electrical wires
along the floor

Ensure that the scarf is kept at waist height

Keep glassware at the centre of the desk at all times.

Only the demonstrator holds glassware.

Only use small amounts of liquid

Demonstrators to wear goggles when pouring

Keep apparatus away from electrical components

Mop up any spillages promptly.

Have eyewash available

Keep all liquids when not in use out of sight and with lids on

Fossils to only be held in two hands by presenter.

Keep fossils at the centre of the projector

Ensure that soft toys are not on the edge of the table. +
If they fall, pick them up promptly.

Encourage all volunteers to walk, not run around the lecture theatre

Ensure the volunteers do not throw or kick the balls. When not in use,
balls to be kept in a box to prevent them from rolling around

Do not use small parts if volunteers are very young children

Ask adults to ensure that children do not stand on the lecture theatre
chairs

*Action To Be Taken In The Event Of An Accident*

Call a first aider in the event of injury

Call first aider in the event of reaction or injury

Parents may administer eyewash to their child

Advise vinegar/weak acid to be washed off

Call a first aider in event of injury

Call a first aider in event of injury

Call a first aider in event of injury

Call first aider in event of injury

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.
