Introduction

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

A few demos of transmission/reflection of waves at boundaries

Useful information

Kit List: 

Oven shelf +
Oil and pyrex experiment (+ maybe lenses) +
Wave machine (requires tape, skewers, and small masses [e.g. jelly
babies, plasticine balls])

Frequency of use: 

1

Explanation

Explanation: 

A few demos on the effects that boundaries have on propagating waves,
the general theme being 'waves cross boundaries easily if the properties
on either side match'

Wave machine: +
Good for going over wave basics. Make by stretching gaffer between two
tables, and evenly space skewers along it (it helps to mark the skewers'
midpoints in advance). Stick another layer of tape on the top to secure
the skewers, and put weights on their ends. You can play with skewer
spacing and weight positions to vary the frequency and create
boundaries. You should be able to reflect a wave of one of these
boundaries, and the difference in wave speed should be noticeable. Note
that the tape will stretch, and will need tightening every so often

The rest of the experiment is basically just Oil+Pyrex, and oven shelf.

[[risks]]
RISKS
^^^^^

1.  Ends of skewers could be sharp
2.  If using sweets for weights, audience could try to eat them, which
is unsanitary
3.  The oil is very slippery, and could cause a nasty slip hazard.
4.  If the pyrex bowls broke they would be sharp.
5.  Children eating sodium polyacrylate spheres and spheres bursting.
6.  Minimal, but if fingers are pushed into ears with long nails it
could cause some minor damage.

[[action-to-be-taken-to-minimise-risks]]
ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Set up wave machine with sharp ends away from audience, don't set up
in a high-traffic area (where people might walk through it), and make
sure people don't lean in close
2.  Keep an eye on children, and mention not to eat the sweets
3.  Be very careful to minimise the chance of this happening, probably
use a towel on top of a plastic sheet to contain any small spills if it
is done inside. Mop up any spills carefully.
4.  Check for cracks before starting demonstrating. If the Pyrex does
break, dispose of it carefully. Be especially careful of any pieces that
are in the oil as they will be INVISIBLE, so it is better to pour the
oil out rather than fishing for them.
5.  Ensure only one child is 'investigating' the spheres at a time so
that they can be monitored. If they burst the sphere ensure that they
don't rub their eyes and that they wipe their hands.
6.  Encourage children to put their knuckles, not their fingers, in
their ears.
