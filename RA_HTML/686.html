                    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We’ve put together kit to talk about microbes- this can be combined into one big experiment, or split into three separate ones. Please try to put the bacteria into one box (a small grey box) and the viruses and parasites into the other box (also a small grey box)</p>
<p>These microbes experiments are new for the 2011 Summer Roadshow, so should be considered a work in progress rather than a well-polished experiment. We’ve included a microbiology textbook in with the virus and parasites box to help you out. Let us know if there’s anything else you’d like to include!</p>
<h2>Bacteria box</h2>
<p>In the box:</p>
<p>•	6 x cuddly bacteria<br />
•	1 x cuddly penicillin bug (to talk about antibiotics)<br />
•	1 x cuddly yeast (to say that not all microbes are bacteria)<br />
•	1 x plate of plastic bacteria (E.coli)<br />
•	2 x bacteria viewers (look a bit like small microscopes)<br />
•	3 x slides sets for bacteria viewers<br />
•	1 x flask for growing bacteria<br />
•	Packets of tools for growing bacteria<br />
•	Laminated fact sheets for cuddly bacteria<br />
•	Laminated instructions sheets for hand washing activity<br />
•	UV hand wash cream (this is £15 per bottle, so use only minimum amount per group)<br />
•	UV light for hand wash activity</p>
<p>Stories you could tell:<br />
- How to grow bacteria in the lab (with the props, see also text book)<br />
- How some bacteria are really good for us<br />
- How you can pass on bacteria (good and bad) on your skin- see hand wash activity notes</p>
<p>BACTERIA: Most bacteria are harmless: there are actually 10 times as many<br />
bacterial cells in your body than your own cells. Some of them produce toxins or<br />
invade your cells, which can make you ill.</p>
<p>Salmonella (Salmonella typhimurium): Gram negative, rod shaped<br />
*SLIDE in microscope box*<br />
Can infect humans and animals, so sometimes infects people of food isn’t cooked properly<br />
(particularly chicken or eggs). Causes gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting…) The<br />
bacterium itself can actually live inside certain types of white blood cell, which is a very<br />
effective way of hiding out from the cells of the immune system that circulate in the blood.</p>
<p>Diarrhoea (Campylobacter jejuni): Gram negative, spiral shaped<br />
Most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. It produces a toxin that kills certain<br />
human cells, which helps the bacteria to survive, without being attacked by the immune<br />
system.</p>
<p>TB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis): ‘Acid fast’ will not gram stain<br />
Infects the lungs when the bacterium is breathed in. Here it gets contained by the immune<br />
system in a tough shell. Only about 1 in 10 people who have the bacterium get ill: this<br />
usually happens when the immune system is weak and cannot contain the bacterium. The<br />
disease can cause damage to the lungs and in really bad cases it can spread to other parts<br />
of the body.</p>
<p>Cholera (Vibrio cholerae): Gram negative, comma shaped<br />
Usually spread when water is contaminated by the bacterium. Produces a toxin that stops<br />
you absorbing water through your intestines. This causes really bad diarrhoea, which can be<br />
fatal as you lose too much water and salt from your body.</p>
<p>Listeria (Listeria monocytogenes): Gram positive, rod shaped<br />
Causes fever and muscle pains. If the bacterium can get to the brain this can cause<br />
meningitis. Pregnant women are the most commonly infected – the mother usually gets a<br />
mild fever but the baby might be badly affected or born early. The source of the infection<br />
is often food – pasteurising dairy foods helps kill the bacteria and reduce the numbers of<br />
infections</p>
<p>E. coli (Escherichia coli): Gram negative, rod shaped *SLIDE in microscope box*<br />
Found in the intestines of most mammals- it’s there inside you only hours after you’re born!<br />
There are lots of bacteria in our digestive system that are harmless to us – in fact they stop<br />
harmful bacteria from living and growing there instead. Sometimes E.coli can make us ill;<br />
some unusual strains produce toxins which can give us food poisoning.<br />
Biologists like E.coli: It’s very easy to grow in the lab and can make lots of proteins and<br />
DNA very quickly.</p>
<p>Stomach Ache (Shigella): Gram negative, rod shaped<br />
Very closely related to E. coli. When the bacterium is ingested it can get inside the cells of<br />
your intestine. It produces some toxins that can also make you ill.</p>
<p>Yogurt (Lactobacillus bulgaricus): Gram positive, rod shaped<br />
One of a number of species that can be used to make yoghurt.<br />
What Wikipedia has to say about the use of L. bulgaricus in the manufacture of yoghurt:<br />
“Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is commonly used alongside Streptococcus thermophilus as<br />
a starter for making yoghurt. The two species work in synergy, with L. bulgaricus producing amino acids<br />
from milk proteins, which are then used by S. thermophilus. Both species produce lactic acid, which gives<br />
yoghurt its tart flavour and acts as a preservative. The resulting decrease in pH also partially coagulates<br />
the milk proteins, such as casein, resulting in yoghurt's thickness. While fermenting milk, L. bulgaricus<br />
produces acetaldehyde, one of the main yoghurt aroma components. Some strains of bulgaricus also<br />
produce bacteriocins which kill undesired bacteria. It is often helpful to sufferers of lactose intolerance,<br />
whose digestive systems lack the enzymes to break down lactose to simpler sugars.”</p>
<p>YEAST/FUNGUS</p>
<p>Yeast for bread and beer<br />
In bread the yeast can use the sugars in the dough for its growth; it breaks them down in a<br />
reaction that produces the gas carbon dioxide, which make the bread rise. In beer the yeast<br />
converts the sugars to alcohols.</p>
<p>Penicillin (Penicillium chrysogenum)<br />
This is a fungus that makes penicillin, an antibiotic that kills some types of bacteria. It does<br />
this to kill off the bacteria that are competing for the food it needs for growth, but we have<br />
used penicillin from this fungus to treat bacterial infections in humans</p>
<h2>Viruses and parasites box </h2>
<p>In this box:<br />
•	5 x cuddly viruses<br />
•	2 x cuddly parasites<br />
•	2 x cuddly mosquitos<br />
•	1 x plastic model HIV virus (in box)<br />
•	3 x plastic cell culture flasks (which can be used to grow malaria parasites in)<br />
•	laminated fact sheets<br />
•	laminated parasite matching game<br />
•	microbiology text book</p>
<p>VIRUSES: Can be as simple as DNA or RNA in a protein coat. They use the cells of<br />
their host to make lots of new viruses. Often these new viruses get released by<br />
causing the cell to burst. Viruses can’t survive for very long outside of cells so new<br />
viruses quickly find a new cell to infect.</p>
<p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus): Retrovirus (RNA genome turns itself into<br />
DNA that integrates into the host chromosome. New viral genomes are produced by transcription)<br />
Can be spread via some bodily fluids and blood. Lives in white blood cells and eventually<br />
kills them, which means the immune system cannot function properly. People where HIV<br />
has killed too many white blood cells have AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome),<br />
and this means that they can become very ill or even die from diseases that would not harm<br />
a healthy person.</p>
<p>Common Cold (Rhinovirus): positive sense RNA<br />
Spreads easily from infected people when they sneeze or contaminate surfaces. The virus<br />
is very happy at the temperature and conditions in the human nose which is where they<br />
initially infect. There are lots of different types of rhinovirus whose protein coats all look<br />
different to the immune system, which is why we don’t get become immune to the common<br />
cold.</p>
<p>Measles (Morbillivirus): negative sense RNA virus<br />
Usually spread by breathing in virus from droplets in the atmosphere. Causes a fever,<br />
rash and red eyes. Most people will have been vaccinated against this with the MMR jab,<br />
which mostly eradicated measles from the UK. However since the scare about the MMR jab<br />
(spuriously linked to autism), the disease has been cropping up in affluent areas of London!</p>
<p>Kissing Disease (Epstein-Barr): DNA virus<br />
Most of you will have this virus right now. It is usually spread via saliva, causing a mild<br />
fever in the majority of the population in early childhood. However some people who don’t<br />
get the virus in early life might get it when they come into contact with other people’s saliva<br />
in their teenage years - they then get Glandular Fever. An interesting thing about the virus<br />
is that you never really get rid of it; some of its DNA forms little circles in the nucleus of the<br />
white blood cells it infects, and it can remain dormant for a long time (occasionally getting<br />
out into saliva but not making you ill). The virus that causes chicken pox can do this in<br />
nerve cells.</p>
<p>T4 (T4-Bacteriophage):<br />
Bacteriophage are viruses but they do not infect humans – they infect bacteria. One day<br />
this might be useful to us for treating bacterial infections (‘phage therapy’).</p>
<p>PROTOZOA: Single-celled eukaryotes<br />
Malaria (Plasmodium falciparum):<br />
Parasite that lives inside a mosquito. When the mosquito bites you it injects malaria<br />
parasites into your skin. The parasites multiply in the blood stream and cause red blood<br />
cells to burst. By living inside your own cells they are hiding from the immune system, like<br />
viruses do</p>
<p>Sleeping Sickness (Trypanosoma brucei):<br />
Parasites are injected into you by the bite of a tsetse fly in Africa. They don’t live inside cells<br />
like malaria but they live in the blood stream –this means they have to do clever things<br />
so they do not get killed by the immune system. One of the things they do is change the<br />
way their surface look; they are constantly making a new coat of different proteins that the<br />
immune system can’t recognize as a parasite.</p>
<p>PARASITE VECTORS:<br />
Mosquito (Culex pipiens):<br />
Mosquitos can transmit some very deadly diseases between people via their bite. Diseases<br />
include malaria (a protozoan), yellow fever and dengue fever (viruses) and a worm infection<br />
that causes limbs to swell up (elephantiasis). Don’t worry, most mosquitos are harmless.</p>
