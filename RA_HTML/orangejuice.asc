Introduction

A useful way to try and explain how taste works

Useful information

Kit List: 

foods needed: +
orange juice. +
chocolate. +
salty corn chips. +
concentrated coffee powder. +
Lemon Juice.

Explanation

Explanation: 

This is an old experiment that is not currently in use. This experiment
also has some important safety issues, so it is critical to read and
understand the risk assessment beforehand.

- Probably best to only work with one or two children for this so you
can keep an eye on them.

- Ask the child to spread toothpaste around their mouth. Perhaps use the
coffee stirrer to give them a bit of toothpaste, and let them use their
tongue to smear it all over - make it nice and foamy!

- As soon as they have finish "brushing", give them a sip of orange
juice. Ask them to keep the juice at the front of your tongue, where
they had the most toothpaste.

- Notice the taste. Ick!!! Not very good!

- Ask them to rinse their mouth out again and repeat "brushing" and
tasting with other foods. This time, taste something sweet.

- Where is the sweet flavor? It should either be missing, or very
faint. +
- Try the same thing with something salty, again brushing first. Again,
the salt flavor is weak or missing.

- Then try it with something sour. I used lemon juice. The sour comes
through just fine.

What is happening? Toothpaste contains detergent, to make it foam and
help it remove food +
from your teeth. This detergent coats your taste buds, which blocks the
sweet and salty +
flavors. Sour and bitter flavors do not seem to be blocked. This is why
you get the bad +
taste from the orange juice. You are tasting the sour and bitter part,
without the sweet +
part.

- If got time also go into how smell and sight are needed to "taste" so
many different flavours (like chicken flavour, tomato flavour etc.) even
though your tongue can only detect four basic sensations(well five if
one counts glutamate, but may be good to ignore that for now...)

- Explain how seventy to seventy-five percent of what we perceive as
taste actually comes from our sense of smell. When you put food in your
mouth, odor molecules from that food travel through the +
passage between the nose and mouth to olfactory receptor cells at the
top of your nasal cavity, just beneath the brain and behind the bridge
of the nose. It's the odor molecules from food that gives most of our
taste sensation.

- Talk about how having a cold or a bunged-up nose could mean they can't
"taste" food as well.

Risk Assessment

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |ORANGE JUICE AND TOOTHPASTE

|RISKS a|
Allergies – children may be allergic to any of the foods

Contamination- foods may get contaminated with other products

Risk of Spreading Infection

Spillage Risk- Liquid may be spilled onto floor and pose a risk

Choking Risk – either with foodstuffs or coffee-stirrer

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Ensure speak to parents before proceeding with experiment about possible
risks.

Use foodstuffs with low allergen risks.

Wipe and disinfect bench before use. Then cover bench with Benchcote.

Keep experiment segregated from other experiments.

If suspect contamination then dispose of food batch immediately.

Use separate cups/ coffee-stirrers/ food portions for each child.
Dispose of materials after use.

Clear up spills immediately.

Only perform experiment on older children.

Carry out experiments on small groups (no more than 2-3 children at any
one time) and closely monitor them at all times.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
case of injury
