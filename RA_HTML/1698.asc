Explanation

Explanation: 

Here's How:

(Line up five glasses. Add 1 tablespoon (15 g) of sugar to the first
glass, 2 tablespoons (30 g) of sugar to the second glass, 3 tablespoons
of sugar (45 g) to the third glass, and 4 tablespoons of sugar (60 g) to
the fourth glass. The fifth glass remains empty. +
Add 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of water to each of the first 4 glasses. Stir
each solution. If the sugar does not dissolve in any of the four
glasses, then add one more tablespoon (15 ml) of water to each of the
four glasses. +
Add 2-3 drops of red food colouring to the first glass, yellow food
colouring to the second glass, green food colouring to the third glass,
and blue food colouring to the fourth glass. Stir each solution.) -
might want to prepare the solutions before, depends how long this
actually takes. If making or replenishing solutions while demonstrating,
you can get children to stir (watch they don't eat it!). +
Now let's make a rainbow using the different density solutions. Fill the
last glass about one-fourth full of the blue sugar solution. +
Carefully layer some green sugar solution above the blue liquid. Do this
by putting a spoon in the glass, just above the blue layer, and pouring
the green solution slowly over the back of the spoon. If you do this
right, you won't disturb the blue solution much at all. Add green
solution until the glass is about half full. +
Now layer the yellow solution above the green liquid, using the back of
the spoon. Fill the glass to three-quarters full. +
Finally, layer the red solution above the yellow liquid. Fill the glass
the rest of the way. +
The sugar solutions are miscible, or mixable, so the colours will bleed
into each other and eventually mix. +
If you stir the rainbow, what will happen? Because this density column
is made with different concentrations of the same chemical (sugar or
sucrose), stirring would mix the solution. It would not un-mix, like you
would see with oil and water.

Do they know about dissolving things? Especially if making the solutions
with them, you might want to talk about salt in the sea and sugar in tea
- how you can no longer see the bits of sugar but it's still there, just
broken into smaller bits and surrounded by the water.

Explain that dissolving more sugar in the water leads to it being more
dense. Ask if they know what that means, more mass per amount of volume,
could say that adding more sugar to the water makes it have more mass
but doesn't change how much space it takes up. Makes sense that the
lighter ones will sit on top of the heavier ones.

It might be beneficial to show what happens if you add a more dense
solution on top of a less dense one to see what happens (they just mix)!

Now repeat with oil and water, try stirring and see them separate out
after a while. (You don't need a lot of oil to see this). See if they
have any idea why we cannot mix the water and oil, hopefully some will
same something like this is because they are unmixable. From here it
will probably depend on audience how much you can explain but should try
to explain what makes them not miscible, ie that one is polar and that
the other is none polar, these terms will need explaining. MODEL FOR
THIS.

Ask them to tell you what they can tell about the oil because it sits on
top of the water. Encourage them to think about the sugar and water
earlier. Hopefully some should be able to tell you that it is less
dense.

Other ideas: +
A measuring cylinder filled half with castor oil, half with water, with
blue ice cubes floating on the top. The ice melts and the blue water
drifts down through the castor oil to sit on +
the meniscus.

Tips: +
Try to avoid using gel food coloring. It is difficult to mix the gels
into the solution. Darker colours eg. black can also cause problems when
they bleed into the other colours so you can't see the rainbow.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION a|
Mix waters of different sugar conc, and so density, with different food
colourings in and show they sit on top of each other in density order.
Show water and sugar solution don’t go back if stirred whereas oil and
water does separate.

Watching coloured ice melt and sink through castor oil.

|RISKS a|
1) Solutions getting in eyes +
2) Drinking of solutions +
3) Slip hazard from spillage

\1) Children may try to eat ice cubes (choking hazard) or drink
water/oil. +
2) Water from experiment may come into contact with electrical parts.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1) pour solutions carefully +
2) watch children carefully, don’t allow them to do experiment
unsupervised. +
3) keep solutions in secure locations

\1) Explain to children that they must not eat/drink anything used in
any experiment. +
Watch small children, and don't let them handle the ice. +
2) Set up experiment away from experiments using electrical parts. If
any electrical parts are nearby, place them above the cylinder filled
with water.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1) Call first aider in event of incident. Use eyewash to wash out of
eyes if trained and confident to do so. +
2) Advise them that the reactants are all edible but to seek medical
attention if they start to feel very bad as experiment has been in
cupboard for unknown amount of time. +
3) Clean up any spillage straight away. Call first aider in event of
injury.

Call first aider in case of injury.
