Plants - looking at germination, their structure and how they produce energy by photosynthesis

Useful information
Kit List: 

\*Needs significant preparation in the days running up to the event\*

-   Beansprouts in plastic containers, germinated prior to event, under different conditions (e.g. light/dark/water/no water/warm/cold)
-   Magnifying boxes
-   Microscope and slides showing section through plant leaves, stem, stomata, germinating seed

Explanation
Explanation: 

Ideas to explain:
----------

For younger children

- Talk about what plants need to grow (water, warmth, light)
- Look at sequence of development i.e. seed, beansprout, small plant, larger plant, bigger plants flower and produce seeds (life cycle)
- Plants need light to produce energy - they don't eat like animals do (avoid using the term 'photosynthesis' with small children)
- Might want to look at plant cells in the microscope. They have a cell wall, so have a rigid shape, unlike animal cells. Green because of the pigment (chlorophyll) that they use to produce energy from light.

----------

Older children

- More detail on the different events happening in early plant development

- More detail on photosynthesis i.e. carbon dioxide converted into sugars, and oxygen is produced (the opposite idea to respiration)
- Gas exchange (Carbon dioxide for oxygen) happens through pores on the underside of leaves called stomata (you should be able to see these on one of the slides - see below).
- Light is absorbed by the green pigment (chlorophyll) in the leaves
- Plants have to transport sugars made in the leaves to other parts of the plant - this happens in the phloem (visible on slides)
- Water is transported from the roots in xylem (visible on slides - see below)

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Looking at plants with and without a microscope</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>Electrical hazard (microscope), especially near sources of water
Using thin glass slide could result in broken glass with risk of cuts
The light fitting under the microscope becomes hot, and could cause burns
Possible allergic reaction to seeds/plants/soil/leaf specimens
Injury from dropping seedling jars/plants
Possible injury from nail varnish when making slides
Trip hazard from microscope cable/extension cord</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>See separate electrical parts risk assessment, keep microscope away from water as it is not required for this experiment
If slides are broken, carefully collect/sweep up broken pieces, wrap in paper and dispose of carefully
Warn children to be careful, turn off lamp when not in use, if it's getting hot put a cardboard shield around (but not touching) the lamp to prevent accidental contact
Ask parents if child is allergic to the plant we are using
Have seedlings in plastic container, and use plastic plant pots
Demonstrator to make stomatal peels using nail varnish, if desired (pre-made slide should be sufficient not to have to do this)
Avoid setting up so wires are in a walkway, tape down cables</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td>In case of accident or allergic reaction, call first aider.
Advise parents/teachers of plants handled in the case of allergic reaction.
Run burns under cold water for at least 10 minutes.</td>
</tr>
