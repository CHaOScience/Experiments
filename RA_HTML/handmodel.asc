Introduction

Public summary: 

Take control of an _enormous_ hand, playing the part of the muscles that
control it! Can you work out how to make a fist? Why are there tendons
running down both sides of the fingers? And exactly how are your thumbs
different to your fingers?

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

General public

Large working model of a hand and forearm, with all the tendons to show
how a hand works.

Useful information

Kit List: 

Working hand model ("Emily"). +
Short lengths of string (optional)

Packing Away: 

The hand packs together with the lung model for storage. It can be
slightly tricky to get this to work, so get someone to show you if you
haven't done it before. After fitting them together, strap tightly with
the red straps. The two together aren't particularly heavy, but they are
bulky and tricky to move so ask for help if needed.

Frequency of use: 

5

Explanation

Explanation: 

This experiment is a bit of a crowd-pleaser. There is a subtle technique
of keeping kids' fingers out of the wooden joints, and after this has
been achieved, all ages will be amused by playing with it.

Explanation

\1. Guess what the model is of – nice and easy start! +
2. Ask what do the pieces of wood represent = bones, and where in the
body they are. +
3. Talk about moving your fingers, and ask what in the body moves them =
muscles (after several shouts of veins, ARGH!!), then where are the
muscles that move your fingers = forearm not in the hand, and the fact
the muscle belly mostly ends quite before the wrist. You can get them to
wiggle their fingers and see if you can see the muscles moving in the
forearm, but not above the elbow (this is often more visible on
demonstrator/parent than child!) +
4. Leads onto the fact that muscles are in forearm, but need to join
onto fingers in order to move them – how? Gives off strings that run
along fingers and attaches to the bones (show on model) – what are the
strings called? = tendons (after more shouts of veins!!). So, to move,
muscles contract (tighten up/become shorter), and pull the tendons,
which pull the bones. +
5. Then let them play around a bit – I usually get them to pick a blue
string (but avoid thumb for now), and then a white string, and see the
difference between them. Blue string goes all the way to the end bone,
so can bend the end joint, whereas white string can’t because it doesn’t
attach to the end bone. +
6. Get them to bend all the fingers (tests if they’ve remembered which
strings bend the fingers) +
7. Then ask how to make the fingers straight again. Most will try to
push the blue/white strings – tell them that doesn’t work because
muscles can only pull. Get them to look at fingers closely and spot any
other strings. Eventually they’ll realise to pull the yellow/purple
string +
8. Ask them why yellow/purple strings makes the fingers straight. If
they struggle, get them to see the difference between blue/white and
yellow+purple = different sides of the hand. Therefore muscles on front
of arm (flexors) pull blue/white tendons on that side, which flex the
joints, and vice versa with other side with the extensors. +
9. So, all around the body, muscles work in pairs to do opposite
actions. Point out biceps on you and say it bends the elbow, then ask
where the muscle will be to make it straight = on the other side,
triceps. +
10. Then ask what’s telling the muscles to contract and pull the tendons
= brain. And how = send messages = nerves, and briefly explain concept
of nerves sending messages +
11. I usually end by saying that to play the piano for example, or type
on a keyboard, your fingers have got to move in lots of different ways,
so your brain has got to send all those messages in the right order to
the right muscles, to pull on the right tendons. So, it’s actually
really complicated just to move your fingers.

Thumbs

The pink string pulls the thumb across the palm. You can use this to
talk about how thumbs can move in an additional special way so you can
pinch things - show them how you can oppose the pads of your thumb and
fingers, but not of your fingers. They may have heard of opposable
thumbs - some will tell you the word, others will recognise it. You can
talk about different animals not having opposable thumbs and thus not
being able to use tools etc.

If you've got the short (c. 6 inches) lengths of cord, you can challenge
them to tie a simple knot in one. When they triumphantly present you
with the resultant knot, get them to do it again without using their
thumbs (police this vigilantly, people cheat without even noticing!).
Usually this is much much harder. If somehow they do it easily, tell
them to undo it without their thumbs. This is more challenging!

General stuff

– Useful to refer to your own or their hand while describing stuff, for
example show the extensor tendons on the back of your hand (they’re a
lot easier to see in adults than on themselves). Get them to feel the
muscles working on themselves or on you. Do this by getting them to
place their whole hand over their arm (both sides!) and then wiggling
their fingers! Then they have to believe you! +
- This can be a good experiment to do with really quite small kids, but
keep it nice and simple with them (i.e. I wouldn’t bother talking about
tendons, just say ‘stringy like things that pull on our bones to make
them move’!)

Additional stuff:

\1. Carpal tunnel syndrome: +
- Carpal ligament bridges wrist bones, making a small tunnel for nerves
and tendons to go through. +
- Median nerve goes through – sensation to most of hand (not little
finger), and muscle control of some thumb muscles. +
- Compression of tunnel walls (due to repeated wrist movements) or
swelling (due to injury/arthritis), causes pressure on median nerve +
- Symptoms – aches, pins+needles, pain, numbness, loss of fine finger
movements e.g. writing. +
- Treatment - stretching exercises, anti-inflammatory drugs, surgery
(cut carpal ligament = relieve pressure)

\2. Difference between ligaments and tendons +
- Explain that a joint is where 2 bones come together and they can move.
But the bones need something to hold them in place, this is what
ligaments do, connect bones to other bones. Tendons connect muscles to
bones so they can move the joints.

|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Wooden Hand model

|RISKS |Finger trap +
 +
Wooden corners - injury risk +
 +
Heavy model which moves easily when strings are pulled +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Do not allow the kids to touch the hand itself when someone is pulling
the tendons

Hand is sanded and shaped to try to reduce this.

Do not let the people pulling the tendons get too violent. Hold on to
the model to prevent it from sliding along the desk, or place it on the
floor if possible.

Ensure kids are behaving sensibly

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
event of injury
