Risk Assessment: 

**Experiment**
**Geological TimeLine Scarf**
**Limestone Composition**
**Fossils and Replica Dinosaur Bones**
**Plushy Visual Aids**
**Scale Model of the Solar System**
**Audience Half-Life Experiment**
**Description**
A ~30m scarf, colour-coded with each geological period.
To covey sheer size of geological time, how long humans have existed for and dinosaurs.
Audience volunteers unroll the scarf, stopping at key stages in geological history.
Dissolving Limestone and collecting the gas produced in limewater.
Observation of CO2 released.
For the use of demonstrator. Placed under the projector to display to the audience.
Use of plushie dinosaurs and other soft “creatures” as a visual aid
To display relative distance from Earth to the asteroid belt. Involves volunteers moving around the lecture room and props (sports balls to scale)
Audience Members Stand Up / Wave Hands in Air and instructed to sit down at different intervals to represent radioactive decay
**Hazard**
Tripping hazard
Strangulation Hazard
Glass Breaking
Vinegar / weak acid spray is irritant
Spill hazard – electrical
Spill hazard – chemical
Swallowing hazard
Dropping of fossils on feet
Falling on the floor and being a tripping hazard.
Tripping or falling whilst moving around the lecture theatre
Balls rolling and becoming a trip hazard
Swallowing of small marble sized balls
Young children falling over from standing on chairs
**Action To Be Taken To Minimise Risks**
Keep scarf off the floor to prevent tripping
Encourage volunteers not to unwind scarf too fast
Ensure scarf unwinding does not occur where there are electrical wires along the floor
Ensure that the scarf is kept at waist height
Keep glassware at the centre of the desk at all times.
Only the demonstrator holds glassware.
Only use small amounts of liquid
Demonstrators to wear goggles when pouring
Keep apparatus away from electrical components
Mop up any spillages promptly.
Have eyewash available
Keep all liquids when not in use out of sight and with lids on
Fossils to only be held in two hands by presenter.
Keep fossils at the centre of the projector
Ensure that soft toys are not on the edge of the table.
If they fall, pick them up promptly.
Encourage all volunteers to walk, not run around the lecture theatre
Ensure the volunteers do not throw or kick the balls. When not in use, balls to be kept in a box to prevent them from rolling around
Do not use small parts if volunteers are very young children
Ask adults to ensure that children do not stand on the lecture theatre chairs
**Action To Be Taken In The Event Of An Accident**
Call a first aider in the event of injury
Call first aider in the event of reaction or injury
Parents may administer eyewash to their child
Advise vinegar/weak acid to be washed off
Call a first aider in event of injury
Call a first aider in event of injury
Call a first aider in event of injury
Call first aider in event of injury

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk assessment.
