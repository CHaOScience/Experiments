Explanation

Explanation: 

NB: This experiment is included as an historical reference, and is
unlikely to be resurrected in the form described here due to it's
excessive malodorous substance content.

Different functional groups have different characteristic smells, e.g.
esters smell sweet and fruity, amines smell of rotting meat. We have a
range of smelly chemicals and try to get the kids to group them
according to smell and hence functional group. We also have models of
all the chemicals so try to get the kids to group these according to
shape (of functional group) and then make the connection between shape
and smell.

Nasal Spectrometry Risk Assessment and COSHH

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Public smell a range of volatile, smelly chemicals. Try to
group chemicals by smell. Look at models and group by shape. Make
connection between shape and smell.

|RISKS a|
\1. Public contact with chemicals +
2. Bottle containing chemical could break +
3. Demonstrator contact with chemicals when preparing experiment +
4. Small children could swallow parts of models +
5. Storage and transport of chemicals

COSHH: risks associated with each chemical used

Ethanol - highly flammable +
1-Butanol - flammable; harmful if swallowed; irritating to respiratory
system and skin; risk of serious damage to eyes; vapours may cause
drowsiness and dizziness +
1-Hexanol - harmful if swallowed +
1-Octanol - none +
Acetic acid - flammable; causes severe burns +
n-Butyric acid - causes burns +
Hexanoic acid - causes burns +
Octyl acetate - none +
i-Amyl butyrate - none +
Methyl butyrate - harmful by inhalation; irritating to eyes, skin and
respiratory system +
n-Amyl acetate - flammable +
1,4-Diaminobutane - highly flammable; harmful in contact with skin and
if swallowed; causes burns +
1,5-Diaminopentane - harmful if swallowed; irritating to eyes and skin +
1-Propanethiol - highly flammable; harmful if swallowed; irritating to
eyes, respiratory system and skin

Please also see Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for more information
about chemicals used

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
\1. Only very small amount (one drop) of chemical used

Permeable membrane lid on bottle ensures only very small amount of
chemical released

Lids taped on to bottles so that they cannot easily be removed

Bottles are distinctive and look like they come from a laboratory, so
noticeably should not be carried off by child

Bottles clearly labelled with orange hazard labels (flammable, harmful,
corrosive) and numbered so that demonstrator is immediately aware if one
is missing

Demonstrator keeps control of all bottles at all time: Do not allow any
of them out of your sight, do not allow public to remove lids

If necessary (e.g. particularly busy event) bottles attached to table
(or other heavy difficult to move oject) via string so that they cannot
be physically removed

Experiment carried out in well ventillated area

\2. Chemicals contained in sturdy glass bottles which should not break
when +
dropped etc

\3. When preparing experiment (pipetting chemicals into bottles) wear
gloves +
and eye protection and perform in very well ventilated area, ideally
fume +
hood, but otherwise outside. Pipettes and contaminated gloves should
be +
left in well ventilated area until smell has subsided and then disposed
of +
appropriately.

\4. Models not to be given to children under age of 7 because of small
parts +
which represent choking hazard

\5. Chemicals stored and transported in locked metal box.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
If bottle breaks: evacuate area if neccessary because of smell, clear up
broken glass and remove to well ventilated area e.g. outside until smell
has subsided then dispose of appropriately.

In case of chemical contact with eyes, rinse immediately with eye wash
if trained and confident to do so. Call first aider and seek medical
advice.

In case of accident or if you feel unwell seek medical advice
immediately.

If chemical swallowed seek medical advice immediately and show
container/label.
