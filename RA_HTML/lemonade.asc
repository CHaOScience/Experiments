Explanation

Explanation: 

Cool down lemonade to about -5°C in an ice salt bath and then open the
lid. As you do so it will freeze. This is because you reduce the number
of solutes in it by letting the CO2 come off increasing the melting
point, it also creates lots of bubbles which can act as nucleation
points for the ice.

Risk Assessment

Risk Assessment: 

Cooling Lemonade to -5°C and then opening it to cause it to rapidly
freeze.

RISKS +
-Slip Hazard if you drop the ice water mix on the floor +
-Cold, but anyone would take their hand out long before it did any
damage +
-Faint possibility of a bottle exploding if it froze hard, and had lots
dissolved gasses in it and it was damaged

CONTROL MEASURES +
-Clean up Spills +
-Don't let sealed bottles freeze hard

IN EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT +
- Call first aider
