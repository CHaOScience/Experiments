Explanation

Explanation: 

Use two methods of invisible ink.

Lemon juice method. +
Use a paint brush to write on the paper in lemon juice, allow this to
dry, then hold it up to the light (heat source). It should brown in the
places where the writing was.

How does it work? +
The lemon juice is acidic. This means that it attacks the paper, so the
parts it is on are thinner and burn more quickly.

Backing soda method +
1. Mix the water (1/4 cup) and baking soda (3 tablespoons) in a cup with
a teaspoon. +
2. Get them to dip a paintbrush in the solution and write a secret
message, thinly. Then wait for it to dry. +
3. Brush some blackcurrant/grape juice across the sheet and the message
should appear.

How does it work? +
Baking soda is alkaline. Blackcurrant/grape juice is acidic. When you
put these juice concentrates on top of baking soda, a chemical reaction
takes place which produces a colour change in the paper.

Other things to talk about: cryptography.

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Compare two types of writing in invisible ink. 1) Lemon
juice on paper, acid “attacks” paper, so if heated the “attacked" parts
go brown first. 2) Use baking soda in water to write with, then cover
page in blackcurrant or grape juice and the message should be revealed.

|RISKS |1) Slip hazard if anything is spilt. +
2) Any of the juices are irritant to eyes and cuts. +
3) Light bulb gets hot.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1) Use small amounts of liquid in
a large container, keep liquids in secure location away from electrical
equipment. +
2) Use paintbrush for writing on paper, don’t squirt any of the
liquids. +
3) Ensure no one touches the bulb.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1) Clear up any
spillage straight away. Call first aider in case of injury. +
2) Call first aider in event of incident. Use eyewash to wash out of
eyes if trained and confident to do so. +
3) In case of burn, call first aider, encourage them to run burnt area
under cold tap.
