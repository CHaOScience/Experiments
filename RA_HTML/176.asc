Explanation

Explanation: 

Looking at different light sources using a CD as a diffraction grating.
Colour mixing with LED colour mixer. Splitting light with a Lens.

Look at a fluorescent, conventional light bulb, LED etc in a CD to see
that they don't have the same spectrum.

Split light (and with any luck recombining it) with a prism

Mix red, green and blue light to form other colours.

Risk Assessment: 

Looking at spectra of different light sources, using both a CD as a
diffraction grating and prisms to split light. Mixing red, green and
blue LED light to produce different colours.

Risks: +
1. Looking at the light from the sun could damage eyes +
2. If examining the spectra from light bulbs, bulbs could be broken +
3. Glass prisms may be dropped and broken. +
4. Looking at the light from bright LEDs may cause eye damage +
5. Bulbs may become warm if left on for long periods of time.

Control Measures: +
1. Never look at the spectra of the sun, or look directly at the light
from the sun, without proper filters in place. +
2. Try to keep lamps where they are not easily knocked over. +
3. Keep the prisms away from the edge of the table. +
4. Make sure that people don't look into the LEDs in the light mixing
box. +
5. Turn bulbs off when not in use, avoid leaving them on for long
periods.

In case of accident: +
1-5. Call first aider in the event of injury. Inform a committee member
of the accident. +
2. Ensure power to light is turned off, keep public away from broken
glass, and clear up immediately. +
3. Keep the public away from the broken glass and clear up immediately.

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk
assessment.

This experiment is sometimes run in a darkroom, see separate risk
assessment.
