Introduction

Public summary: 

Seeing how different sized bird beaks will result in speciation based on
food availability

Useful information

Kit List: 

Set of silicon 'beaks' (oven mitts which open with different
appetures) +
Beads/balls +
Pots/dishes

Explanation

Explanation: 

*Set up and activity* +
Place the different sized beads in the pots at different locations on
the table. +
Offer the group the selection of silicon beaks. +
Challenge them to pick up as much 'food' (the beads) as possible in a
minute (or longer if this time period is too short). Then ask them to
stand by the pot which they were most successful at picking up the beads
from.

*Explanation* +
***Not finished, at all!***The group should be split between the
different pots depending on which beak they have been using. Talk about
how different organsims are more successful in different environments -
natural selection and survival of the fittest. Darwin's finches are a
really good example of this.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Picking up beads and balls from dishes using silicon oven
mitts

|RISKS a|
Choking if beads are eaten/swallowed

Slip hazard if beads spill on the floor

Allergic reaction to silicon

Injury if pots break and form sharp edges

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Ensure the children don't eat the beads, keep out of reach of small
children and set up table away from major walkway

Keep bead pots away from edge of table, discourage boisterous behaviour

Ask if anyone has a silicon allergy before giving oven mitts

Discourage boisterous behaviour, and use plastic pots rather than glass.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
Call first aider, ask parent to firmly slap back of choking child

Sweep up beads as soon as they spill, call first aider in case of a fall

Call first aider

Clear up broken items promptly. Call first aider in case of injury
