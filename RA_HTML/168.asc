Useful information

Kit List: 

# Sand - about 2.5cm in a washing up bowl +
# fluidised Bed +
# reversible hoover - small variac +
# Fluidised bed sand (finer and more uniform than normal) +
# Things of a range of densities that can be floated/sunk in the dry
sand, similar set to go in water/thixotropic sand.. wood, rocks +

Explanation

Explanation: 

Thixotropic sand

Just add water to sand until it is thixotropic - this is a bit more of a
challenge than the cornflour, but if the surface is actually wet it
normally works.

Get the kids to build a sandcastle, then shake the bucket and the sand
should slowly liquefy

Explanation: +
Because the sand is much heavier it squashes the water from between the
grains just by its weight, so the only way you can get the lubrication
back is to shake them apart so the water can get in between.

Uses: +
The ground liquifying is a big problem during earthquakes, and can often
cause more damage than the shaking itself, eg in a 1964 Niigata
earthquake in Japan.

Fluidised bed:

Fill bed with sand, attach hoover in blow mode (attach pipe under cover
in the middle). The hoover is a bit powerful, so it is a good idea to
vent some of the air out the side to avoid blowing all the sand
everywhere, we should have a device for doing this, but something may
have to be manufactured using gaffer tape.

Get them to feel the sand without air, then get them to feel it as you
turn the air on. It will suddenly feel light, will flow easily and
almost behave like a liquid - you can float and sink things in it - you
should be able to float things in it that won't float in water.

You can get the child to bury things that float in it, then blow air and
they will float up, and vice versa

Explanation: +
Basically the sand particles can't move past one another normally as
they are touching, but if you blow sand between them the bounce around
and can joggle past one another. You can look at it like a blown up
model of a liquid with all the particles joggling around so it will
flow.

Uses: +
It is used to move things like flour around (which is why you can
transport it in tankers.) Also as a way of doing reactions where you
need a large surface area eg burning things well.

Fluidised beds are used for burning coal in power stations, as you get a
really large surface area, and you can add Sulphur and Nitrogen Oxide
scrubbers as lumps in the fluidised bed.

This also has a similarity to quicksand, if you have a (water) spring
under sand, it can fluidise the sand which you can sink into (the water
acts like the air in this demonstration). This is particularly dangerous
in big sandy tidal flats, as when the tide comes up, you can get water
trapped under an impermeable layer, and when you walk over the top you
can release this, liquefying the sand you are standing on, which will
then solidify again, leaving you stuck in the sand with the tide coming
in!

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Blowing air through sand, making it flow like a fluid (and
allowing more/less dense items to sink/float through it).

|RISKS |1. Blowing sand into people's eyes/faces. +
 +
2. Sand on a hard, smooth surface can be a lubricant/trip hazard +
 +
3. Slip hazard if water is spilt +
 +
4. CHaOS committee adding water to electronic components may cause a
hazard +
 +
5. Wet Sand from fluidised bed getting transferred to childs hands then
into eyes +
 +
6. Explosion due to pressure drop across container +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Set up carefully, using blower
on low power, work out correct air flow rate for amount of sand used.
Less sand needs lower flow, important to work out correct settings on
set-up (without the public sticking their heads over the bed) and to
make sure if anything changes (for example some of the sand is tipped
out) +
 +
2. Use play-pit type sand (less dusty) +
 +
3. Sweep up any spilt sand/mop up any water immediately +
 +
4. Do not pour water into the electrical equipment +
 +
5. Ensure experiment is set up near sink to wash hands in afterwards,
Demonstrator ensure children wash hands after demonstration +
 +
6. Check for cracks before use +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. Call first aider in
event of injury. +
 +
If sand gets into eyes, discourage rubbing (sand may scratch), sterile
eye wash should be used to flush it out +
 +
2&3. Call first aider in event of injury. +
 +
4. Unplug, disassemble and put on a radiator +
 +
5. If sand gets into eyes, discourage rubbing (sand may scratch), Call
first aider. sterile eye wash should be used to flush it out, only
administer if trained and confident. +
 +
6. Treat as 1.
