~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• Slow cooker, run on high for 30 mins in setup, then turn down to
"warm" heat before visitors arrive. +
• Stores box (small blue) has spares of most of the kit in the kiwi DNA
box. +
• Please use only 1-2 cm3 of ethanol/isopropanol per experiment to
conserve our supplies for the whole roadshow. There are some plastic
pipettes to help you with this. +
• Poking the DNA at the end. As well as the cocktail sticks described in
the main explanation we’ve now got some clear plastic cocktail stirrers,
which are easier to get into the cocktail glasses when you’re getting
the DNA out. +
• RNA model: in a plastic Tupperware tub in the main box, and new for
2010. Don’t feel you have to use this, but if you want to talk about DNA
being used as a template to make proteins it’s a nice prop, and has the
same colour coding. +
• Laminated sheets: provide some useful images, and there’s a wheel to
show how DNA code is used to encode amino acids. Please try to dry these
if they get damp during the day. +
• DNA model in box. Roughly 1.4bn times bigger than real life (if my
maths + memory is correct).

[[overview]]
Overview
~~~~~~~~

Breaking open the cells of a kiwi fruit to extract the DNA. You can
demonstrate it to one family or a whole crowd as a show, discussing
cells, DNA and proteins!

Tips for demonstrating:

* It's difficult for the audience to participate in the practical
activities, so it's more of an interactive show with lots of questions
and answers.
* Do the preparation work before the audience arrives! I work the
experiment as a continuous process and maybe use five kiwis in the day.
* Be aware that young children won't know a lot of science. For
instance, don't assume they know about cells (most don't), they know
about humans being animals and that plants and animals have a lot in
common. They might not even have reached the stage where they relate the
idea of parts of the body having different structures and functions.

[[preparation]]
Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to have:

* Isopropanol or ethanol on ice (as it works best when cold). If no ice
is available, isopropanol seems to work better at room temperature than
ethanol.
* Water bath heated to "warm"
* Use masking tape or similar to divide the water bath into pint-glass
sized sections so that the glasses don't fall over when you put them in
the water bath
* A kiwi or two peeled and cut into 1 cm chunks
* A bottle of lysis buffer - contains washing up liquid, salt and water.
As a general guide, in a bottle, put about 1/8 volume salt and dissolve
in 3/4 bottle of warm water, then top up with washing up liquid and
invert a few times to mix. You don't want it particularly thick, so err
on the side of less washing up liquid - you can always add more.

[[basic-procedure-and-explanation]]
Basic procedure and explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps of the experiment are below in bold, with an example way of
talking through the experiment for younger children. It includes
questions and answers (of course if you get the right answer modify your
reply). Try and use simple words and up the language as you deal with
older kids or adults. You can use this experiment as a basis for talking
about scale, with respect to cells and molecules and also as a basis for
discussing what DNA does, and how similar our DNA is to kiwis (>50%).

*You may want to have some mashed DNA in lysis buffer incubating, and
use that rather than the one the group with you has prepared as it takes
a while for the cells to lyse. Preparing a couple before you begin
demonstrating also means you can check the lysis buffer is ok.*

---

Do you know what this is? It's a kiwi fruit. And what's a kiwi fruit
made out of? (you'll probably get seeds, flesh, skin types suggestions)

What are all living things made out of? If I scratch my nail across this
what do I have under my finger nail? Cells. _Just as a house is made out
of bricks every living thing is made out of cells but they're very
small_. There are different cells in the flesh to what there are in the
seeds or in the skin and in you their are hundreds of types of cell.
Different types of cells in your eyes, blood, brain and skin too.

First what I want you to do for me is mash up some kiwi fruit.

*Add a lump of Kiwi to a plastic cup and get them to mash it with the
rolling pin (gently!)*. You can explain that what they're doing is like
demolishing a house, all you've got left is a pile of bricks.

Now what I'm going to add is some washing up liquid.

*Add lysis buffer to the cup containing the kiwi to a depth of about 1cm
and put the cup in the water bath*. You can ask: what does washing up
liquid do? (You'll probably get "it makes bubbles" at this stage!) What
do you use it for? Cleaning plates. Well what does it take off the
plates? The grease and fat. It does this by dissolving the fat: this is
like what happens when sugar or salt disappears into water. A cell is
basically a bag full of water and other important things like DNA, and
the bag is made from fat so the washing up liquid dissolves and breaks
up the material the bag is made from (the cell membrane). This releases
everything that is inside.

What do you know about DNA? Discuss! DNA is like the plans for building
us. Just like you need plans for building a hospital. But if you build a
hospital it's useless unless you know how to build the doctors, nurses
and beds inside them and the doctors and nurses know what to do. So it's
not just the plans for building you it's also the instructions for how
you should be run. Alternatively, DNA could be like an instruction
manual for how to build a person (or kiwi), and there is some inside
almost every cell in our body and every cell in the kiwi. What we're
going to do is we're going to take the DNA from the kiwi fruit.

*Take the kiwi mush/lysis buffer mix out of the water bath*. So this
liquid here is full of DNA.

*Pour the liquid from the cup into a plastic flute through a sieve to
remove the lumps.* We need to separate the DNA from everything else in
the mixture.

*Get out the alcohol and pass it around the noses present, taking care
to keep control of it.* What does that smell like? (kids often recognise
it as hand gel) It's not water, it's pure alcohol. I emphasize this as
children commonly think anything that is liquid has water in it.

*Using a pipette, put about two pipettes-full of isopropanol into the
glass by pouring it down the sides of the glass so it doesn't mix too
much with the rest of the mixture and forms a layer on the top.*

*Show the glass around.* What you can see here are two layers, the green
layer is the water with the DNA in and the clear layer is the alcohol
layer.**

Now do alcohol and water mix? Sure they do. Because if you look at a
bottle of whiskey or beer there's only one layer there. So what's
happening is the water is moving up into the alcohol layer and the
alcohol is moving down into the water layer *wibble your fingers about*
and the two are mixing.

*The DNA is the stringy white stuff that collects between the two
layers.* Can you see anything appearing between the two layers? Some
stringy white stuff forming? That's the DNA. It takes a while to see
this sometimes, so you can either show them a previous group's glass or
pick up some of the bottom layer with a pipette and slowly release it
through the top layer. It's helpful to have a few really good examples
lying around to show "one that we made earlier", to make sure that they
see the DNA even if the experiment didn't work for them.

Possible discussion points:

Now what I'm going to do is try and pick up a single molecule of DNA.
(showman mode, on the end of a spoon I fish a little bit out.) +
What's the largest number you can think of? Because what i have here on
the end of this spoon is billions molecules of DNA. Just as the Kiwi is
made up of the bricks we call cells the cells are made up of molecules.

So how big do you think one of these molecules is? It's about a
millionth of a millimetre across. But because DNA is an especially long
molecule it's a metre long. Now what I want you to do is use your
imagination and I'm going to pick up one molecule of DNA *pretend to
pick up a very thin strand and pass it to a child to hold and stretch it
out to about a metre*

Now this is a molecule of kiwi DNA and if we use your imagination again
I can pick up a molecule of your DNA and that's about a metre long too.
Now in your right hand we've got a molecule of kiwi DNA, this is the
instructions on how to build and run a kiwi and in your left hand we
have your DNA which is the instructions on how to build and run you. Now
how similar do you think these two are.

How much is the same? (Sweepstake the entire audience) About 85cm is the
same (alternatively 85% the same), that's this much. (Mark out 85 cm and
you've got around percentages!)

That's because both you and the kiwi are made up of cells and the cells
in the kiwi do the same sort of thing as the cells inside of you. They
make more cells, they use sugar and oxygen to make energy and use
protein and fat. So who do you think is the most similar person in the
worl to you? It's your brother or sister, not your mum or your dad.
Which is why you've got to look after you're little brother as they're
the most similar person in the world to you. You're all but a tenth of
milimeter the same as you're brother or sister and you're all but about
millimetre the same as anyone else in this room. You're all but 2 cm
different from a chimpanzee. Which is why I think we should look after
everything in this world as we're really not very different from
anything else.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Heat mixture of salt, water, washing up liquid and mashed
up DNA (60°C) for 15 mins. Decant some of the liquid into a plastic
champagne flute. Drizzle an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol/isopropanol
on top. DNA visible at interface. Using model and posters to explain
DNA.

|RISKS a|
1.  Ethanol/isopropanol - Irritant, flammable, and very toxic
2.  Water bath - Hot water can scald
3.  Glassware and plastic containers- If broken can cause cuts
4.  Kiwi/detergent solution Harmful
5.  Sharp knife
6.  Wet surfaces - Slip hazard
7.  Small risk of allergic reaction to kiwi fruit in a small minority of
people.
8.  Risk of heat element and stirrer overheating if not covered by
water.
9.  Small pieces in model may present choking hazard.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1.  Only have a small amount of ethanol/isopropanol out, away from naked
flames AND THE PUBLIC. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Do not ingest.
Only allow parents and children to mash kiwi on its own - not once mixed
with detergent or ethanol/isopropanol. Ensure eyewash is nearby and that
you know the location of it.
2.  Maintain the water bath at 60°C out of reach of children. Ensure has
passed PAT test in last 2 years. Ensure cables are taped to the
ground/table to reduce risk of person tripping on/pulling the cables.
3.  Dispose safely of any broken glassware immediately. Keep spares out
of reach. Check plastic container and ethanol/isopropanol are
compatible.
4.  Do not allow children to mash the kiwi once it has been mixed with
detergent or ethanol/isopropanol. Keep all mixtures within
demonstrator's reach. Avoid contact with eyes or the mouth. Try to work
on a surface which is not at eye level. Demonstrator can show children
how to mash the kiwi without splashing kiwi everywhere. Know the
location of the nearest eyewash
5.  Supervised use only. Keep sharp knives away from children. It's
impractical to cut all the kiwi beforehand, but after cutting fresh
kiwi, keep the knife in the pencil case provided and keep this in a
drawer, out of sight.
6.  Wipe up any spills. Keep experiments away from electrics.
7.  Demonstrator to check that visitors are not allergic to kiwi fruit
before commencing the experiment.
8.  Demonstrator to ensure that element is always covered with water and
stirrer is always rotating.
9.  Keep model completely assembled and prevent children taking it
apart. Keep the black stopper on top of the stand as this prevents the
rest being disassembled.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1.  Wash off skin. Use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and
confident to do so, and call First Aider. If ingested call First Aider
immediately.
2.  Run cold water over affected area for at least 10 mins. Call First
Aider
3.  Call First Aider
4.  Use eyewash to wash out of eyes if trained and confident to do so
and call First Aider. If ingested call First Aider immediately.
5.  Call First Aider.
6.  Call First Aider.
7.  Call first aider. Rinse skin with clean water.
8.  Turn off electricity at mains. Call first aider if necessary. Allow
to cool before using again.
9.  If child ingests small part of model, call first aider immediately.
