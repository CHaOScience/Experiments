Useful information

Kit List: 

Electrolysis tower (~ 6' tall, white cover, don't drop it - you will
need 2 people to move it) +
0-15V variable power supply OR Power pack of doom +
Small red box (approx. contents): Water models, small air blower,
MgSO~4~, deionised water, funnels etc. power connectors, piezo-electric
sparker, silencer, ping-pong balls)

Packing Away: 

Please do not attempt to set up or pack up electrolysis unless you have
been shown previously how to do it and are confident you know how (one
of the committee members at the event will be happy to show you what
needs to be done) - if you get tap water in the electrolysing chamber
you will get some very strange results (mainly due to metal oxide
formation removing the oxygen as you make it), and the chamber may need
to be cleaned.

Frequency of use: 

5

Explanation

Explanation: 

*In a nutshell* +
Water is split into hydrogen and oxygen, which are then recombined
explosively at different concentrations to launch a ping pong ball into
the air. This means that you can investigate energy conversion,
stoichiometry, what is an explosion, etc. etc..

*Setting up Electrolysis* +
***Note: Please do not attempt to set up or pack up electrolysis unless
you have been shown previously how to do it and are confident you know
how (one of the committee members at the event will be happy to show you
what needs to be done) - if you get tap water in the electrolysing
chamber you will get some very strange results (mainly due to metal
oxide formation removing the oxygen as you make it), and the chamber may
need to be cleaned.*** +
(1) Ensure the tower is secure and won't fall over. There is a sound
muffler in the box that fits over the ignition chamber. It is strongly
advised that you use it if you are going to be demonstrating this for
any length of time/are indoors. +
(2) Attach the power cable to the current controller +
(3) The wires are connected (those with tape on inserted first, and the
sparker can have its wires go in any way around, for the electolysis
apparatus itself, connect red and red, and black and black) +
(4) Ensure that the apparatus on wet ground (if outside use separate
upside-down trays for the appartus, and for the power supply and
sparker) +
(5) Use a funnel to pour the MgSO4 solution into the back chamber (such
that it goes to the electrolysis chamber), ensuring that no water enters
the sparking chamber +
(6) Use a gravity siphon (use plastic tubing to suck some water to
insert the tap water into the front (mixing) chamber, again ensuring no
water enters the sparking chamber

*How to set up (and run) the experiment* +
***Note: Please do not attempt to set up or pack up electrolysis unless
you have been shown previously how to do it and are confident you know
how (one of the committee members at the event will be happy to show you
what needs to be done) - if you get tap water in the electrolysing
chamber you will get some very strange results (mainly due to metal
oxide formation removing the oxygen as you make it), and the chamber may
need to be cleaned.*** +
(1) Ensure the tower is secure and won't fall over. There is a sound
muffler in the box that fits over the ignition chamber. It is strongly
advised that you use it if you are going to be demonstrating this for
any length of time/are indoors. +
(2) Pass current between the platinum wires in the reaction chamber at
the bottom, this splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, which are
collected by two inverted burettes. ***Do not use too much voltage for
the water splitting, as you may start causing some strange
by-reactions.*** +
(3) Holding the mixing chamber valve shut, release hydrogen and oxygen
from their burettes in an appropriate ratio into the mixing chamber. +
(4) Release the mixing chamber valve to let the gas mixture into the
explosion chamber, then use the piezo igniter to fire it (some off the
gas will vent out around the ping pong ball - this is ok). +
(5) The electrodes that make the spark are now wet; if you need to
repeat the explosion quickly the air blower may be used to dry them more
quickly - in practice by the time you've done the introduction again the
electrodes may be dry.

*What you need to know about the experiment* +
Water is H~2~O and, if you apply enough energy (needed to break bonds),
it can be split into its constituent parts (there should be some
models). +
You should be able to see that there is twice as much hydrogen as
oxygen. +
You can get the energy back out rapidly -> heat ->expansion ->
acceleration of the ping pong ball. +
The sparking electrodes a become wet: you've made water! +
A detonation is an explosion which travels at supersonic speeds (you
should hear it!), and hydrogen and oxygen will detonate at the right
concentrations.

*Want to know more?* +
The main point to get across is that water is made out of hydrogen and
oxygen and these are gases. But as you go on you can also describe the
energy in -> energy out aspect, stoichiometry and molecular structure
and also relate it to how we would have to make hydrogen for cars.

In starting the explaining at the bottom of the apparatus you can ask
what the children can see in the bottle at the bottom. Water and wires.
I then go on to say I'm going to put some electricity in the wires, now
what can you see? Bubbles. What's in the bubbles?

I then explain how were are turning water into what it's made out of. So
what's it made out of? Excellent if they can answer this. Otherwise, do
you know another name for water? It's surprising how many kids get
H~2~O. Why is it called H~2~O? Because it's made out of hydrogen and
oxygen - "Hydrogen times 2, H~2~ and oxygen O."

Once that's settled, you can go for the molecular models. Breaking them
up into two H~2~ and one O~2~ molecules. While this is in I explain what
we're going to do next in recombining the molecules back to H2O giving
them a good shake. Random collisions aren't a bad model for a chemical
reaction.

Now is also a good time to talk about the energy in/out business if
you're going to. Though for years 6 up really. Energy from electricity
is used to split the O and H and is then stored in the O~2~ and H~2~
molecules. When they recombine the energy is released as heat. Cycling
up a hill is the clear analogy, I always like pointing out that as you
come down the hill you think that it's "speed for free" but it's not
really, you're getting the payback for all the effort you put in cycling
up the hill.

We then try some logic and I turn the power off and draw their attention
to the bubbles at the top of the tubes. One is twice the size. Which one
is the Hydrogen? Next explain how you're going to mix the gas and
arrange your volunteers and check the trigger works.

As you mix the gases you can say, if we need 8 ml of hydrogen, how much
oxygen do we need? Then we're pretty much onto the pop. Once that's gone
grab the ball quick. With luck there should be some water on the bottom.
Show them this, as this is your opportunity to hit home. "Can you see
that? You've that made water!" Which is cool.

Parents and teenagers will be interested in the hydrogen cars angle.
With this audience I probably would have started with the hydrogen cars.
Anyway, you can be a bit environmental pointing out we have to use
energy to make hydrogen, and it is only ever an energy store. you can
also burn the hydrogen in an internal combustion engine (like at the
top) or in the exact reverse of what happens on the electrodes at the
bottom, to make electricity right out of the hydrogen and oxygen in a
fuel cell, then driving a motor.

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Separating Hydrogen and oxygen and then recombining them
ignited by a spark to fire a ping pong ball into the air.

|RISKS |1. Explosion in the electrolysis chamber +
2. Explosion in the mixing chamber +
3. Evolution of chlorine +
4. Loud explosion - more of a problem for the demonstrator, because of
the repeated nature +
5. Being hit by ping pong ball +
6. Increased hazard from mains electricity due to presence of high ionic
strength solution

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Designed so any excess gas
vents to the outside, so even if the power is left on there will be no
major build up of gas. +
The chamber is made out of a tough plastic (PET) that won't shatter +
There is a polycarbonate blast shield in case something does go wrong +
2. The valve at the top of the mixing chamber is designed so it defaults
to be open, so gas won't build up when you are not paying attention. +
The explosion is separated from this chamber by water so it shouldn't
ignite +
The explosion occurs behind a blast shield +
3. Use deionised water (chloride ions have been removed), and use MgSO4
as an electrolyte as this will not decompose before the water.
Experiment must only be set up by a demonstrator familiar with the
apparatus and the solution required. +
4. Ignition is by modified kitchen lighter. Is on the end of a long
wire, allowing everyone to stand well clear of the explosion (energy
dissipates as r^2). A sound muffler can be attached to the top of the
column. +
5. Make the explosion chamber quite high, so you can't look in the top.
Ball is very light and would not hurt much. +
6. Ensure that apparatus is secure before filling (also prevents risk of
tower falling). +
Do not fill/top up apparatus whilst power unit is nearby. +
Keep power unit raised above level of base of apparatus +
See electrical parts RA

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. Call first aider in
event of injury +
2. Call first aider in event of injury +
3. Turn off power, remove any casualty from area, call first aider +
4. Contact GP if there is a problem +
5. Call first aider in event of injury +
6. If solution splashes onto power supply turn off immediately at mains
and close experiment. +
In case of injury call a first aider (and turn off power if safe to do
so).
