<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Drive a piston down a cylinder so fast that the air heats up enough to ignite some cotton wool.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>1. Risk of tube cracking and firing bits
2. Risk of pushing too hard and damaging demonstrator
3. Risk of burns</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>1. Tube is made out of polycarbonate which is very tough.<br />
<br />
Inspect tube before demonstrating experiment.<br />
<br />
Cover tube in tape/fablon to catch any splinters.
2. Only demonstrate by a demonstrator that is strong/heavy enough and knows what they are doing.
3. Only demonstrator should handle cotton wool. Put out quickly once ignited</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td><p>Call first aider in case of injury.</p></td>
