The binary adder
A bag of marbles

Packing Away: 

It goes into a cardboard box.

Explanation
Explanation: 

A mechanical binary adder, which adds two numbers represented by marbles.
Get people to figure out what it does by repeatedly adding one, see if they can spot how to read a number off or add a number other than one. Talk about how this is how computers represent numbers. Why do they use something different? Easy to store in this format instead of 10 possible digits we only have one, we can then store this as +ve or -ve, on/off or something like that.
There's also options to talk about logic, very easy switches for operations AND and XOR (exclusive or). How do we add numbers using these? AND to see if we need to carry one, XOR tells us if what we need in that bit.
You can also demonstrate overflow by adding big numbers together.
You could talk about how computers store negative numbers, sign and magnitude is probably most obvious way of doing it. There's also 2's complement. Or you could talk about fractions and storing the number of halves, quaters... or as numerator denominator.
If you wanted you can even get people to play about with finger binary.

<br />
2. Keep unused marbles in a container, and keep track of how many there are<br />
3. Watch children with the marbles, only give them one at a time to immediately put in the machine.</td>
