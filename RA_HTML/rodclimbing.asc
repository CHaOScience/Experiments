Explanation

Explanation: 

*In a nutshell* +
Twisting a rod in the polymer solution causes long molecules to wrap
onto the rod and creep slowly upwards (like spaghetti on a fork).

*How to set up the experiment* +
The premade solution is polyacrylamide (between 0.5 wt% and 1 wt%)
dissolved in glycerine (same thing as glycerol) with food colouring,
which goes with the rod. The fork and spaghetti can be used to
demonstrate how a polymer behaves when it moves.

*What you need to know during the event* +
1) Get the kids to twist the rod in the slime. Wait for them to notice
that it's doing something weird... +
Explain that all materials, like the slime, are made of molecules. The
slime molecules are really long and thin, like spaghetti...,The slime
contains a polymer called polyacrylamide. The solution has some
properties of a liquid, for example it finds its own level in a
container, and some of the properties of a solid, for example it is
elastic.

\2) Let them have a play with the spaghetti-string and fork, and see
that the string climbs up the fork. +
Encourage them to see how the length of the molecule makes the spaghetti
get tangled, creating a viscous solution. Explain what's going on - as
the string wraps onto the fork out of the mixture, it pulls more string
with it. As it pulls tight, some of it gets forced up over the surface,
pushed out of the way as more string wraps on. This is what's happening
with the polyacrylamide, but on a much smaller scale so we can't see the
individual "strings". *Demo only works with the prongs of the fork on
the plate as otherwise the spaghetti is squashed out the bottom (which
is preferred because of gravity)*. +
This occurs due to the circular flow of the liquid around the rod
becoming sheared, which causes the forces perpendicular to the surface
(upwards) to become much larger than those effects causing the circular
motion, leading to the liquid rising up onto the rod. This effect
(called the Weissenburg effect) can occur in any liquid capable of shear
(think batter or similar things in baking partially rising up the whisk
when mixed), but as the rising is due to shearing effects, this will
become magnified for more viscous liquids, such as the polyacrylamide.
Also, note that this effect just requires some rotational motion, and if
this can be achieved without the rod, a bump will still form around the
vortex formed by the stirrer. As seen in this youtube video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK2ajzCfNBU [1]

What kind of molecule do they think might pour much more easily? (e.g.
water, sand, sugar which are small and round molecules instead of
chains).

Sometimes they will ask why it forms a 'blob', and doesn't just rise up,
this is because of this effect falling off as the width of the 'blob'
decreases (less shearing can occur), and so gravity pulls the layers
down until a blob is formed

\3) Try lifting the rod out of the slime or touching the surface of the
slime lightly with the rod. The solution has a very high extensional
viscosity (resistance to flow when pulling as opposed to pushing, which
is how we usually think of viscosity). Imagine trying to pick up one
strand of cooked spaghetti from a huge pile – it’s the same thing
(except that you’re pulling out hundreds, if not thousands of strands of
spaghetti).

*Tips for demonstrating* +
Don't let them put their fingers in the slime +
1) Acrylamide (the monomer) is harmful, but there is none of this in the
solution. The slime (POLYacrylamide) that we're using is non-toxic. The
degree of polymerisation (the length of the chains) is so high that even
the shortest is several thousands of monomers long. +
2) It is also very sticky and if it starts getting on people's hands,
then we'll lose it all very quickly.

*Want to know more?* +
Polyacrylamide is a polymer; this means that the molecules (the smallest
parts that are still polyacrylamide) are very long and thin like cooked
spaghetti, lengths of string or long hair. Polyacrylamide is used to
thicken foods.

Polymers behave elastically due to the different states they can adopt -
extremes being the coiled and extended states. In the coiled states,
there are lots of different conformations which come about from molecule
rotating in different parts along its length, but only one that makes it
straight. That means that the coiled state is much more likely (this is
entropy!), and so the polymer tries to go back to it if stretched.

The glycerine that the polyacrylamide is dissolved is used as a cough
mixture and is also added to icing to keep it soft.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Weissenberg effect. If rod is rotating fast in a polymer
solution the polymer will climb the rod.

|RISKS |1. Eating polymer (note: polyacrylimide is non-toxic). +
 +
2. Slip hazard. +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Stop kids from eating polymer.
If you are using polyacrylimide, use a very high molecular weight so
there are no monomers. Children must not handle the slime during the
activity! +
 +
2. Clear up any spills. +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. Polyacrylimide is
non-toxic. Advise parents what has been ingested and to see their GP
should illness develop +
 +
2. Call first aider in event of injury +
