Explanation

Explanation: 

ACTIVITIES- EAR MODEL: +
-show the model; it's important to orientate them; i.e.the white bit is
the skull; get them to think about that the majority of their own ear is
actually inside the skull +
-take model apart; look at/identify individual bits - what might they
do?

ACTIVITIES- SEMICIRCULAR CANAL DEMONSTRATION +
-point out semicircular canals on the anatomical model; show them the
water filled circular tube and say that that's what they look like
inside +
-get them to spin the water filled tube- the pink bits move- so the
fluid moves as well (for things to say please see below) +
- what else is important for balance: get them to stand on one leg and
let them close their eyes; is it easier or harder with their eyes
closed? (for things to say please see below)

TIPS FOR DEMONSTRATING: +
If the kids are a bit older, they will often know quite a bit about how
hearing works. However, they often know very little about balance, so
it's good to talk about that a little more. +
If the kids are really interested and know a lot already, you could talk
a bit about soundwaves.

BASIC PROCEDURE AND EXPLANATION:

EAR MODEL:

What ears are for? +
- All our senses, ears, eyes etc there so we can get information from
outside into our brains. In the case of ears we want to convert sound
into something we understand, music, speech or whatever.

Sound: +
- The outside bit of ear's a funny shape, helping it to collect sounds
and tell us a bit about where they are coming from. Sound makes the air
vibrate, different sounds make it vibrate different amounts. This causes
our ear drum to vibrate. +
-If you've got the direction-swapping device (ear defenders with crossed
tubes and cones) to hand, you can use this to explain how we locate
sounds according to which ear they arrive at.

Ear drum: +
- Lots of kids have heard of this. I'm often asked about grommets (lots
of kids have these): They are +
small tubes that can be put through the eardrum to help drain fluid and
allow air to circulate in the middle ear.

Bones in the ear: +
- Inside the ear we have the smallest bones in our body. Think how much
bigger this model is compared with our ears. The bones join the ear drum
with the inside bit of our ear, they vibrate as well. They help make
sure that as much of the energy from the sound outside gets passed into
the inner bit of our ears as possible. There are also tiny muscles
attaching to them that can help protect our ears against sounds that are
too loud.

Inside the ear: +
- This is really clever and quite complicated (!). Tiny little cells
with hairs on can detect the vibrating. We have nerves taking messages
from our ears to our brains to tell us about the type of sound we're
hearing, they're a bit like electrical cables so these tiny cells
convert the vibration into an electrical message. +
- Compare ear model to skull to see where all this is going on.

What happens in people who are deaf? +
- The message is lost somewhere along the way. Maybe the sound cant get
to the eardrum because we have wax in our ears. We can get infections
inside our ears behind our eardrums where the little bones are, if this
gets filled with fluid the bones cant vibrate properly. Or the cells
with hairs on or the nerves can be damaged so the message can't get from
our ear to our brain.

BALANCE:

Do we use our ears for anything else? +
- They help us to balance too, so even if we close our eyes we still
have some idea of which way up we are. Get them to stand on one leg and
close their eyes or something. What happens when they close their eyes?
It's more difficult, so we need our eyes for balance, too. +
- There are little tubes filled with liquid at different angles. When we
move, the fluid moves (bit like a spirit level?!). We can sense the
fluid moving-that's how our brain knows that we're moving - can then
help us balance movements. What happens when we get dizzy? We spin
around lots so the fluids move round the tubes (use model), when we stop
the fluid keeps moving for a bit after. So our ears think we're still
moving, our eyes say we've stopped and our brains get confused. Similar
idea in car sickness - when you look down at a book, your eyes start to
think you're not moving, but your ears still think you are, so brain get
confused again.

OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT:

Ever noticed ears going funny in tunnels/on aeroplanes? +
- Get them to breathe out, and then swallow while pinching the nose shut
and with the mouth closed. There's a tube between our ear and throat
that is normally closed but is opened when we yawn or swallow. It helps
us by equalising the pressue in the inner ear and in the outside world,
because if the air pressure (or better explain pressure without saying
the word somehow!) around us is different to inside our ears our eardrum
gets pulled in or pushed out, and opening the tube equalises the
pressure, allowing the eardrum to return to its normal position. This is
why sucking sweets helps when you go up in aeroplanes - I think because
the sucking and swallowing causes the tube to open so the pressure
difference is equalised frequently and so your ears don't 'pop'.

What is sound? +
Sound travels in waves. It's like when you throw a stone into a lake-
waves travel from it. The stone is the sound (i.e. a word we say), and
our words/music etc. can make waves in the air, just like the stone can
make waves in water; the eardrum in our ear can then pick up the waves;
our ear converts these waves into signals, they travel to the brain, the
brain interprets them as words/music

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Various medical models.

|RISKS a|
Small Parts, could be swallowed

If broken parts could be sharp

Some parts have fairly sharp points - risk to eyes

Note the functional ear model is only filled with a few mls of water and
is not a risk if it bursts

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Do not let children play with experiments unattended

Remove broken models

Sharp points filed down or taped over to be as safe as possible

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
Call first aider in case of injury

Advise parents to take child to A+E if an item is swallowed
