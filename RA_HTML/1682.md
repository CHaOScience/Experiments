Scale of the Solar System
=========================

<span class="submitted">Wed, 04/02/2015 - 23:49 — zephyrost</span>
Introduction
Public summary: 

By comparing sizes and distances we can scale our solar system all the way up from the Earth and the Moon, up to our nearest star, and you might be surprised how far that actually is!

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

By comparing sizes and distances we can scale our solar system all the way up from the Earth and the Moon, up to our nearest star, and you might be surprised how far that actually is!

Useful information
Kit List: 

Golf ball - Moon
Globe - Earth
Marbles - Earth/Sun on different scales
Red foam ball - Jupiter
Card with pin-prick hole - Sun/Solar system on bigger scales

Packing Away: 

Don't lose your marbles!

Explanation
Explanation: 

For globe earth:
Golf Ball moon - at a distance of 4m
c=6ms-1

For 2m (roughly demonstrator height) Sun:
Earth marble
Jupiter ball
c=1ms-1 (GUESS!?!)

Sun marble
Earth 2m away
Jupiter 10m
Neptune 60m

Sun 1mm (pin prick hole in card)
Neptune 4m
Alpha Centauri 29km

Solar System (sun to neptune) 1mm
Alpha Centauri 10m

Risk Assessment
Date risk assesment last checked:

Risk assesment checked by:

Date risk assesment double checked: 

<span class="date-display-single">Wed, 01/02/2017</span>

Risk assesment double-checked by: 

Mattlem

Risk Assessment: 

Potential risk:
1) Tripping or falling
2) Ball rolling off and getting underfoot
3) Small balls used in some parts of the experiment being swallowed

Solution:
1) Demonstrator must emphasise that children must walk, should stop everyone walking to actually do explanations
2) Must be made very clear to children that they may not kick or throw the balls ever
3) Do not use small balls parts of experiment for audiences of very young children
