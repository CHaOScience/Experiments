Vegetable oil and pyrex
=======================

<span class="submitted">Sat, 13/02/2010 - 01:26 — dmb52</span>
Introduction
Public summary: 

Ordinary glass objects seem to disappear as you submerge them in a bath of oil. This experiment is spectacular and very messy!

Public visibility:

General public

Useful information
Kit List: 

-   2 pyrex bowls (1 big, 1 small)
-   Vegetable oil (note: works less well/not at all if other types of oil are used)
-   Paper towels
-   Sodium polyacrylate spheres - optional
-   Pure water - optional
-   Coffee jar with pre-prepared spheres - optional

Packing Away: 

The oil may be recovered for reuse provided that it hasn't gained too many impurities (such as grass...)
Wash bowls in warm soapy water where possible.
Make sure outside of oil can is clean before putting in box.

Frequency of use: 

4

Explanation
Explanation: 

### What to do

1.  Fill the large bowl with oil.
2.  Parts of the smaller bowl which are fully surrounded by the oil become invisible - you can either pull the bowl out of the oil, or put a bowl in, the effect is the same.

### Why this works

Glass is see-through, so how come we can see things made of glass at all?

It's all down to the fact that light travels through glass and air at different speeds. \[1\] When light moves from one material to another, it changes direction (refraction). When we look at a glass object, we don't see the glass itself, we see the bending of the light from objects behind it. \[2\]

Light travels through vegetable oil and pyrex glass at the same speed: they are said to have the same *refractive index*. When the Pyrex bowl is surrounded by oil, light passing though them doesn't change speed, and hence doesn't change direction, as it moves into the different materials. You don't have any way of seeing the smaller bowl, you only see the edge of the oil or the outer bowl.

### Why does the light bend

If the wavefronts of the light hit the interface at an angle, then one end ends up moving more slowly than the other end. This makes the light bend.

Go and see the water-tank experiment for a hands-on demonstration of refraction.

(For a better explanation, take a look at the [Making Pyrex Invisible](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/making-pyrex-invisible/) <span class="print-footnote">\[1\]</span> experiment on the Naked Scientists).

### If the balls have been prepared ...

The same effects can be observed using sodium polyacrylate spheres in pure (de-ionised/distilled) water. Sodium polyacrylate is a super-absorbent polymer which can absorb a few 100 times its own mass in water - hence it effectively has the same refractive index as water. The spheres take a few hours to absorb the required quantity of water so this part can only be done if the spheres have been pre-prepared.

In a non-cross linked form the polymer absorbs water much more quickly but sadly isn't transparent. This form is used in baby nappies.

\[1\] The "speed of light" is defined in a vacuum; in denser materials it travels slightly more slowly.
\[2\] And any impurities in the glass - this is why most glass is green if you look at it side-on. Optical glass (for optical fibres, etc) is much higher purity.

Risk Assessment: 

### DESCRIPTION

Putting a pyrex bowl into vegetable oil. Since they both have the same refractive index the pyrex bowl will disappear.

### RISKS

1.  The oil is very slippery, and could cause a nasty slip hazard.
2.  If the pyrex bowls broke they would be sharp.
3.  Children eating sodium polyacrylate spheres and spheres bursting.

### ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS

1.  Be very careful to minimise the chance of this happening, probably use a towel on top of a plastic sheet to contain any small spills if it is done inside. Mop up any spills carefully.
2.  Check for cracks before starting demonstrating. If the Pyrex does break, dispose of it carefully. Be especially careful of any pieces that are in the oil as they will be INVISIBLE, so it is better to pour the oil out rather than fishing for them.
3.  Ensure only one child is 'investigating' the spheres at a time so that they can be monitored. If they burst the sphere ensure that they don't rub their eyes and that they wipe their hands.

### ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT

Call first aider in case of injury.
