Introduction

Public visibility: 

Demonstrators

Teachers

This talk will explore the concept of parasitism and give examples of
parasites in the wild that live at expenses of other animals or plants
as well as explain parasites in human that can be medically important.

Useful information

Kit List: 

@1 +
- Clear punched pockets, A4, 6-10 of this +
- Print out images of eggs +
- Print out images of cuckoo and reed warbler

@2 +
- A small opaque (or covered) box containing enlarged tapeworm made from
plastic sheet or fabric

@3 +
- 2 tupperware, sealed, containing cooked Tagliolini

@4 +
- Giant slide and coverslip = big aryclic sheet (Check cupboard for one
that Lia used before. If need a new one, make 75 cm x 25 cm for slide,
and 23 cm x 23 cm for the coverslip) +
- A soften milk chocolate bar (soften possibly by keeping in a trouser
pocket) +
- Spatula or spreading knife to scoop the “chocolate” +
- A small bottle of water and large transfer pipette if possible.

@5 +
- Printed sheet containing list of antibody combination to give to
audience (check room capacity, and make ½ of this number)

Packing Away: 

- Depending on how wear and tear they are, punched pockets containing
images of eggs and reed warbler can be kept. +
- Keep the box of enlarged tapeworm. +
- Bin the pasta, keep the tupperware. +
- Clean the giant slides + cover slip + spatula and keep them. +
- Bin the sheets of antibody combination.

Explanation

Explanation: 

(This talk is previously known as "Parasites: nasty visitors of your
body - CBS talk 2016")

Full talk will be put here..once written! For now, the structure will be
as followed.

@ indicate audience volunteer and hands-on bit. There will be more
interactive moments for audience to respond during the talk too.

What are parasites - a life style, a phenomenon - living on others - and
there are many of them living inside or outside bodies here are a very
few example.

Parasite in wild - cuckoo birds, toxoplasma +
@ Distinguish cuckoo eggs – print off picture of cuckoo eggs and reed
warbler eggs individually and ask for volunteers to come out and hold
them, ask if audience can tell which one belong to the cuckoo in
isolation and then when they are next to the warbler eggs. To find
answer, turn around the paper/remove the front page to reveal a picture
of baby + play the call of cuckoo or reed warbler (might need assisstant
here).

Parasite in human - toxoplasma (and/or human malaria), schistosoma,
tapeworm +
@ Volunteer to pull an enlarged tapeworm out from a box +
@ Pass around cooked pasta (Tagliolini) in a sealed tupperware =
life-size tapeworms +
@ Faecal smear with soften milk chocolate bar (Yummm) on a giant slide +
identify parasite species from egg shapes

Top tips from the most successful long-live parasites +
- camouflage (e.g. mimicry in cuckoo birds, schistosome) +
- calm us down (e.g. lots of worm parasites) +
- hide&seek (e.g. malaria, (nurse cells), trypanosome, toxoplasma) +
@ Identifying antibody to recognise coating surface of trypanosome –
audience will get a sheet containing list of different possible antibody
combination (give both colour and letter – think colour-blindness +
adult see letters, kids see colours), then I show trypanosome on
powerpoint with different coating in the front, ask audience to shout
out the matching number as quick as they can.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Ensure that stairs are clear of obstacle and lighting is bright enough
to see the steps.

Handle the objects with care.

|DESCRIPTION |Two volunteer come to the front to hold the enlarged
tapeworm box and to pull the worm out.

|RISKS TO AUDIENCE a|

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Ensure that stairs are clear of obstacle and lighting is bright enough
to see the steps .

Handle the objects with care .

Advice volunteers to not walk backward while pulling the worm out but to
stand at a fixed spot instead.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call a first aider.
|=======================================================================

@ Pass around cooked pasta (Tagliolini) in a sealed tupperware =
life-size tapeworms

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Tupperware of pasta passed around the lecture theatre for
the audience to have a feel of life-size tapeworm

|RISKS TO AUDIENCE a|
The tupperware drop and hit others or themselves.

Children may eat pasta - allergies or food poisoning risk.

Dizziness or eye strain when have a close look into the tupperware and
then look up to see the lecture at distance .

|RISKS TO PRESENTER |None.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Keep the tupperware content light and choose a design with no sharp
corner .

Keep in sealed tupperware and gaffa tape lid shut.

Choose tupperware with clear wall and lid to prevent the need for a
close focus.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call a first aider if
help is needed.
|=======================================================================

@ Faecal smear with soften milk chocolate bar on a giant slide

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Two-three volunteers come to the front and prepare faecal
smear slide using chocolate bar. Some chocolate is spread on the giant
plastic slide, some water is added to the chocolate by pouring out from
the bottle or use the transfer pipette, use the spatula to mix the
chocolate and water, lay the giant coverslip on top. Done!

|RISKS TO AUDIENCE a|
Stain on clothes or body parts (e.g. hair and eye!) with chocolate.

Water spillage on body, floor, electrical appliances

Injury from hard object such as the slide, the coverslip, and the
spatula.

Chocolate may contain allergen ingredient.

|RISKS TO PRESENTER a|
Stain on clothes or body parts (e.g. hair and eye!) with chocolate.

Water spillage on body, floor, electrical appliances - slip hazard and
electrical hazard

Injury from hard object such as the slide, the coverslip, and the
spatula.

Physical injury when moving the giant slide.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
Keep the chocolate and water bottle away from audience when not in use
and ensure the the lids are closed properly.

Perform the activity away from electrical appliances and electronic
sockets.

Have paper towel at hands in case of spillage or stain.

If possible, have a round instead of sharp corners on the giant slide
and coverslip and use plastic spatula.

Choose chocolate that contain no allergen or warn the participant .

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
Chocolate should get easily washed off, water will be plain and have no
colour.

Wipe with paper towel .

Ensure that the area especially the floor are cleared of spilled water
to prevent slipping

Call a first aider if help is needed.

|=======================================================================

@ Identifying antibody to recognise coating surface of trypanosome

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Audience respond to Trypanosome surface coating by
shouting out the matching antibody on their sheet.

|RISKS TO AUDIENCE a|
Dizziness or eye strain when have a close look on the information sheet
and then look up to see the lecture at distance

Paper cut

|RISKS TO PRESENTER |None.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |Ensure that the print is large
enough to read with ease.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call the first aider if
help is needed.
