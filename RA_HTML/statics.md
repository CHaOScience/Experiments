Static Electricity
==================

Introduction
Various experiments with static electricity.

Explanation
Explanation: 

Doing various static electricity and magnetic experiments, to show their properites and similarities.

- Playing with magents, they have North and south poles.
-- The effect of magents on iron, iron filings etc

- Charging up balloons, and polystyrene, what do they do to other things, do they always attract.

- applying a charged thing to corflour vegetable oil mix - it makes it go hard in the same way as applying a magnet to iron filings makes them go stiffer.

- ferrofluid, - we have some, you can make analagies if you like, it is cool.

- charging things by earthing them near another charged thing

- Kelvin water drop experiment - this would be very good for smart alec kids or parents, it charges up drops of water just by them falling by electrostatic influence, it basically magnifies

Risk Assessment: 

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td>Playing with magnets, and electrostatics, so charging stuff up with your hair etc using ferrofluid, and looking at a kelvin water drop electrostatic generator.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RISKS</td>
<td>Strong magnets could finger trap, or shatter when colliding
Vegetable oil could cause a slip hazard if spilt
Kelvin drop model will spray drops of water up to a metre possibly causing an electrical hazard
Kelvin drop model will generate enough voltage/charge to give a shock smaller than you would get from a nylon jumper
ferrofluid stains horribly</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS</td>
<td>Only use one strong magnet at a time and cover in gaffer tape to absorb collisions
Clear up any spills
Make sure that any electrical equipment/sockets nearby is covered with plastic. Be aware of how far they are going.
Encourage children Not to touch it as it may hurt.
It should be in a container, don't open the container</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT</td>
<td><p>Call first aider in case of injury.</p></td>
</tr>

This experiment contains mains electrical parts, see separate risk assessment.
