Introduction

Display of several optical illusions, to illustrate the way the brain
perceives certain visual stimuli

Useful information

Kit List: 

various optical illusions (laminated sheets)

Explanation

Explanation: 

IN GENERAL:

These optical illusions are best used with the eye model/blind spot
test. Some explanations may be a little difficult for younger children.

STROOP EFFECT

To do:

•Get the kids to read out the colour of the words (tell them
specifically that they should not read the actual words) – first with
the sheet where the colours and words match, and then on the sheet where
they don’t – and time them (or get their friend/sibling to time them if
you’re working with more than one child) +
•Is there a difference? (Hopefully it will take them longer to say the
one where the names and colours don’t match!) +
•Ask them why this might be – basically, the words have a strong
influence over your ability to say the colour – the interference between
the different information (what the words say and the colour of the
words) your brain receives makes it more difficult +
•Couple of different theories – words might be read faster than colours
are named (speed of processing theory) or possibly naming colours
requires more attention than reading words (selective attention
theory) +
•Might be quite nice to do this comparing very young children with older
ones if possible – might expect that younger children, who are less
confident at reading, might experience less interference and therefore
see less difference in their times

Extra stuff:

•There is some evidence that the anterior cingulate area/dorsolateral
prefrontal area might be active while performing the Stroop test –
thought to be important for conflict monitoring/resolution +
•You can see similar effects if you’re scared of spiders and the words
are related to spiders e.g. “hairy” and “web” – it takes you longer to
read the colours of these words than a set of neutral words. Again, this
is thought to be because the scary words grab your attention too much
and slow you down.

CHECKERBOARD SHADOW ILLUSION

To do:

•Very simple – ask the child if squares A and B are the same colour
(probably will say they aren’t) +
•Then show them second picture – they are! +
•If still not convinced – might be worth making a mask with holes in the
appropriate places so you can see that they are in fact the same

Explanation:

•Visual system needs to determine the colour of objects in the world +
•Has to take into account shadows – a white surface in shadow might be
reflecting less light than a black surface in full light +
•Visual system uses several tricks to determine where the shadows are
and how to compensate for them +
•First trick – check that is lighter than neighbouring checks is
probably lighter than average, and vice versa +
•In figure – light check in shadow is surrounded by darker checks – even
though check is physically dark, it is light when compared to its
neighbours +
•Dark checks outside shadow – surrounded by lighter checks – look dark
by comparison +
•Second trick – shadows often have soft edges, while paint boundaries
(like the checks) often have sharp edges +
•Visual system tends to ignore gradual changes in light level so that it
can determine the colour of the surfaces without being misled by
shadows +
•'Paintness' of checks – aided by form of “X junctions” formed by 4
abutting checks – this type of junction is usually a signal that all the
edges should be interpreted as changes in surface colour rather than in
terms of shadows or lighting +
•Effect really demonstrates successes rather than failure of visual
system – visual system not very good at being a physical light meter –
but that is not its purpose – important task is to break image
information down into meaningful components and thereby perceive the
nature of objects in view

HERMANN GRID ILLUSION

To do:

•Stare at the central intersection of white lines +
•Black dots appear to flash in the peripheral intersections of white
lines but not in the one we’re staring at

Explanation:

•Complicated – probably more for older children/adults +
•Lateral inhibition between centre and surround of receptive field
(analogy of positive and negative numbers – if you have the same amount
of both, they cancel each other out. Light hits the receptive fields –
the particular pattern of activity determines what information is
transmitted to the rest of the brain) +
•Receptive field that lies at the intersection of the white cross has
more light falling on its inhibitory surround than does receptive field
that lies between 2 black squares (see lower bit of diagram) –
excitatory centre of receptive field between squares yields a stronger
response than that which lies at intersection of white cross +
•Upper part of diagram – receptive fields in central fovea – much
smaller than rest of retina (as we have lots and lots of receptors
here)– so in all cases, both the centre and surround are completely in
the white sections, and you don’t see the illusion at the intersection
where you stare

YOUNG GIRL AND OLD WOMAN (or other similar illusions)

To do: +
• Duck or rabbit? +
• Native American Indian or Eskimo? +
• Girl or woman?

Explanation:

A lot of optical illusions are caused by ambiguities in 'perception'.
Our eyes contain receptors that send signals to our brain about the
light that we see. 'Perception' is how our brain interprets these
signals and tries to make sense of them. Where there are ambiguities in
perception there can be more than one interpretation of what we see,
this is what’s happening here. The lines and shapes of an image have two
different meanings depending on which perception you have at that
particular moment. E.g. what is the young woman's chin is the tip of the
old woman's nose. Once you see both interpretations, you cannot see only
one of them. The other will keep "popping" into your vision from time to
time.

NECKER CUBE (and similar)

To do:

•Is the red dot inside or outside the cube? +
•Cube appears to flip – sometimes appears to be inside, sometimes
appears to be outside +
•(The other one is similar – perceptual flipping – get them to try with
this one when they have seen the “flipping” with the Necker cube)

Explanation:

•The drawing is obviously 2D – but our brains automatically perceive it
as a 3D cube +
•However, the drawing does not give enough information for the visual
system to know exactly which face of the cube is at the front +
•Makes the point that what we see is merely a “best guess” made by our
visual system (the 2 different orientations can be thought of as 2
different hypotheses that the brain selects between)

If you can get hold of a computer – there is a really nice spinning
female silhouette illusion as well which makes this point even more
nicely (http://www.flavor8.com/images/spinningwoman.gif [1]) You have to
stare for a while – but she should suddenly start rotating in the
opposite direction! If you have a group, you could also ask which way
they start seeing the figure rotating and see if any way (clockwise or
counterclockwise) is more popular than any other.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Various displays - could be attached to display boards

|RISKS |It it possible that the display boards could fall on someone. If
used properly this should be unlikely

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |Use light professional
displayboards so they are not too heavy +
 +
Make sure the display boards are stable. Do not use them flat without
taping them to something solid. +
 +
Mark boards with highly visible stuff (eg. hazard tape, white paper) if
they are being used in the dark room.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
event of injury. +
