Explanation

Explanation: 

[[in-a-nutshell..]]
In a nutshell..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Show kids that there's more to light than the colours that they can see-
and how this can explain why some ordinary things glow in "black light"

[[how-to-set-up-the-equipment]]
How to set up the equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is best set up on the floor so that you don't look directly at the
bulb. Put the lead and switches of the box towards you, with the flat
side of the box towards your audience. The experiment is better in a
dark corner/ in a dedicated dark room area. See the Risk Assessment for
more details, but do thing about avoiding trailing wires in the dark!
Also, there should be a power lead for the light box with this kit-
please don't pack it with the main box of extension cables! There's lots
of extra things in the box- if you keep them in the empty blue box when
you're not using them it's easier to find them in the dark/ helps people
avoid tripping over them!

[[what-does-the-box-do]]
What does the box do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turn over the box **with both lights switched off**, and show the kids
the two bulbs. One is for "ordinary/normal" white light. The other bulb
is a UV bulb- a kind of light human eyes can't see. There is a switch
for each on the back. Turn it back over as soon as you're done with this
to avoid UV directly into people's eyes.

See Risk Assessment for more details, but briefly: this particular UV
light is pretty safe- it's not that far into the UV, so isn't as
energetic/ dangerous as some other sources. You should hopefully spot
that it gives off weak visible light too. It's also fairly weak - but
*don't use it while it is facing up* just in case!!

[[what-is-light-uv-light]]
What is light/ UV light?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The light most of us are really familiar with is white light. But that's
actually a mixture of different colours. Most of the time we can't tell
that, but sometimes we can see these colours split up, like in a
rainbow.

Do you know the colours of the rainbow? Ask them to tell you! +
[Red -> Orange -> Yellow -> Green -> Blue -> Indigo -> Violet (basically
purple!)]

It turns out that there are more kinds of light than our eyes can see.
Some kinds of light are "redder" than red is - we call that kind of
light "infra-red" (there's another CHaOS experiment about this- check it
out!). You might have seen images from cameras that can detect this kind
of light, perhaps watching animals at night on TV, or police chase
criminals with helicopters. At the other end of the rainbow there are
other kinds of light that we can't see. These are more blue/ more purple
than violet, and we call this kind of light "ultra violet".

It's weird to think that there's kinds of light we can't see, but not
all kinds of eyes detect the same light. For example, some people can't
tell red and green apart, which is called "colour blindness". Another
example: some insects, such as bees, can see UV light. Some types of
flowers have extra patterns in UV, so this helps them find the nectar in
the middle of a flower! (How cool is that?!)

[[but-what-about-wavelength-spectra]]
But what about wavelength/ spectra?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add this extra level of detail with caution: it can be too much detail
to take in if they've never thought about UV/ IR before, and you can
overwhelm them. You can come back to this later on once you'rve showed
them some of the cool things that glow!

EM Spectrum: we call all the kinds of light (including UV, IR, visible)
"electromagnetic radiation". One way of understanding this is to say
that all these kinds of light have different sizes of wavelength.
There's some charts in the box that you can point at when you explain
this. Start with the rainbow: Red light waves are wider/longer than blue
light waves. Following on from that, infra-red has longer waves than red
light; UV has a shorter waves than blue. If you go further outside that
you can see microwaves (that you can cook with) and radio waves (which
can hold information. like music). These have a longer wavelength, much
longer than infra-red. If you go the other way you get to X-rays- these
have smaller waves than UV!

Energy: Another way of viewing the light is as a stream of particles. We
call them photons. They are like small balls travelling at the speed of
light. And photons of different colours have different energy. Blue
photons have more energy then red ones and ultra-violet ones have even
more energy. This if why UV can cause damage to your skin. (You can use
analogy with a light and heavy ball. The heavier has more energy and can
harm you more if thrown upon you.) It causes damage to the cells (which
can cause cancer if it goues really bad). When you get sun burned you
have absorbed too much of UV. So wear suncream to prevent this! +
(And X-rays have even more energy and do not stop on your skin - they
can go through your body so you can use them to see what is inside. But
they are also more harmful and that is why it is used as little as
possible.)

[[some-things-glow-if-you-put-them-under-uv-light]]
Some things glow if you put them under UV light
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Put an object from the box under the UV light. Boring old white paper
works- though pretty patterns on driving licenses/ credit cards/
banknotes are a good start if you have them! Either way, this first item
should glow! Here's a way of explaining this...

\1) Turn on the UV light +
2) Place a (fluorescent) object underneath it - it should glow. +
3) What's happening? How can we see glowing if we can't see UV? +
4) It's fluorescence! (Use this word! Here's a simple explanation- let
us know if you have an alternative!)

The object absorbs or takes in light that we can't see- UV light. The
object can then change the light from UV to a kind we can see. The
energy in the UV light is being converted into a different visible form,
and things that do this are called fluorescent.

Wikipedia has a more precise explanation, but it depends on
understanding lots of other technical words! +
_"Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed
light or other electromagnetic radiation. It is a form of luminescence.
In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore
lower energy, than the absorbed radiation."_ +
(From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoresce [1])

[[where-are-uv-lights-used-in-everyday-life]]
Where are UV lights used in everyday life?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[in-shops-to-check-if-money-is-fake-see-markings-on-banknotes]]
In shops, to check if money is fake! (See markings on banknotes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ask if they've ever seen notes being checked in shops.You can ask
parents if they have a five pound note you can borrow briefly. If you
look at the note, there are all kinds of features visible to the eye
(metal strip, watermark etc.) but if you put the note under the UV
light, you can see extra information, like the value of the note. This
is useful in preventing forgery because printing with UV sensitive ink
is difficult and expensive. Again, the UV gives the special inks energy
so they give out light. Don't forget to give the fiver back

[[in-discos-to-make-white-things-look-super-bright]]
In discos, to make white things look super bright!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You might have seen this!

[[fluorescent-objects-in-the-box]]
Fluorescent objects in the box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[highlighters]]
Highlighters:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fairly boring in white light, but spectacular under UV. Draw on white
paper or non-fluorescent card, on even a smiley face on the back of your
hand!

[[glowsticks]]
Glowsticks:
^^^^^^^^^^^

- show them glow sticks in the UV - which will glow. Glow sticks get
their energy from a chemical reaction rather than UV, if you give them
energy from UV they will still glow though

[[tonic-water]]
Tonic water
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is probably the brightest fluorescence in the box, so I usually
leave it until last. It's quinine that's causing the glow- this compound
is more famous for helping to kill malaria parasites when it was added
to tonic water. In the past it was in much higher doses than it is now.

For more info on tonic water visit:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_water [2]

[[washing-powder]]
Washing powder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Residual powder makes your clothes look whiter by helping balance out
the yellower colours of sad old white clothes. +
**This gets everywhere, need to replace blocks!!**

[[phosphorescent-things-in-the-box]]
Phosphorescent things in the box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Phosphorescence is very like fluorescence a chemical in the paint
absorbs energy from the UV light, but instead of releasing it again in
miliseconds, it releases it slowly over minutes.

[[glow-in-the-dark-stars]]
Glow in the dark stars:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As above!

[[glow-in-the-dark-paint-tube-not-presently-available]]
Glow in the dark paint: tube (not presently available)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apparently this stains, so don't open the tube! (There is some
phosphorescent paint, this does the same thing as fluorescent dyes but
releases the energy much more slowly -> glow in the dark stars etc. NB:
this should be well wrapped in plastic (whilst being non-toxic it is
very staining) - you can often see it glowing through the container.)

[[glow-in-the-dark-board]]
Glow in the dark board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is also a board coated with the phosphorescent paint - put it
under the UV light for 10 seconds (or more - doesn't do any harm), then
turn the light off and let them see how the board carries on glowing.
Turn the light back on and invite them to put their hands on the board.
Make sure they keep their hands in the same place for at least 10
seconds, and see if they can guess what the board will look like after
they take their hands away - the effect will be most long-lasting if you
turn the UV light off at almost the same time as they take their hands
off the board. Some parents may want to take photos!

[[why-is-there-sunscreen-in-the-box]]
Why is there sunscreen in the box?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- UV light from the sun (not this box, so it's safer than sunlight!) has
lots of energy. This damages your skin (or cells, and ultimately, the
DNA) when you absorb/ take in too much of this. +
- If you use sun screen it can absorb the UV/ block it from reaching
your skin, which reduces the damage the sunlight can do +
- See this in action: spray a white sheet of paper with a bit of
sunscreen. Predict what will happen (should look black). Try it under
the light. +
- Try drawing with the sunscreen- you can write hidden messages! +
- Combine this with highlighter pens- you should be able to block
fluorescence. +
- Try not to use too much sunscreen -it's pretty expensive...

================ +
*Bits of an old explanation- should all be in section above!*

I start off trying to get the idea across, that UV is a colour, but you
just can't see it..

What colours are there in a Rainbow? -> ROYGBIV..

Have you thought that there might be some other colours that you can't
see? If they are older ask them if they have heard of infra red,
microwaves, radio waves, X-rays, UV -> they are all colours of light
that your eye can't see

Explain that the tube gives off UV and show them what happens when you
put the paper in the UV. This is because when UV hits the paper it gives
it some energy, which it can release as blue light...

Do you know what UV does to your skin? normally they don't

What happens to your skin if you stay out in the sun too long -> sunburn
-> Due to UV +
Sun cream

What do you put on to stop you getting sunburnt? -> sun cream

What do you think it does to the UV? -> Stops it

What do you think will happen if we put sun cream on the paper? Quite
often they work out that it won't glow

Get them to draw stuff on the paper with the suncream then put it in the
UV light -> dark lines. Which I was impressed with the first time I
tried it.

It's always more striking if you do the
drawing-on-the-paper-with-suncream in the light (take them outside the
darkroom) and then bring the paper in... in the darkroom it's harder to
see how little difference the suncream makes to visible light. Which I
(and lots of parents) think is really cool... sometimes I manage to
convince the kids, too. +
If you've got a group working round the darkroom experiments it's worth
being aware what they've already had demonstrated to them, as if they've
seen, say, polarised light, they should (OK, might) have some idea about
what (you want them to tell you) light is.

*Fluorescent things*

Get them to play with the highlighter pens (they are much more
impressive on paper or cardboard that doesn't glow) +
Glow sticks get their energy from a chemical reaction rather than UV, if
you give them energy from UV they will still glow though +
Paper money and driving licences (security marking)! +
Driving licences also have patterns only visible in UV.

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Use UV light to observe effects of suntan lotion and other
samples

|RISKS a|
1. Electrical hazard

2. UV light

3. Trip hazard

4. Broken tube including mercury

5. Risk of ingestion of washing powder sample, or getting it into eyes.

6. Some people have an allergic reaction to suncream. Avoid getting in
eyes.

7. Risk of ingestion of split glow stick - chemicals can cause
irritation to skin and eyes and vomiting if ingested.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS a|
1. Use covered tube. Set up of box keeps lamp off possibly wet floor.
Ensure has passed PAT test. Read separate electrical parts RA.

2. Use soft UV - our UV tube was on sale to the general public so the
wavelength is at the safer end of the UV spectrum. The experiment is set
up so that it is not easy to look directly at the uv light. Warn users
not to look directly at it. Avoid prolonged skin exposure.

3. Place wires sensibly (not across middle of room), and put the UV
light in a place it is not likely to get trodden on. Tape down if
necessary.

4. Tube is inside the light box to protect it.

5. Washing powder to be kept in a sealed clear plastic bag.

6. If children want to put suncream on their skin, first make sure that
they've previously used suncream without allergic reaction.

7. Don't let children repeatedly play with and bend glowsticks

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT a|
1. Call first aider in event of injury.

2. Call first aider in event of injury.

3. Call first aider in event of injury.

4. If lamp becomes broken, keep the public well away from the area, and
ventilate area where breakage occurred. Take usual precautions for
collection of broken glass. Do not use a standard vacuum cleaner for
cleaning up dust; instead, pick up pieces/dust with a damp cloth or damp
paper towels. Place materials, including the cloth/towels, in a sturdy
closed container to avoid generating dust. After you have picked up all
that you can, then vacuum the area. Finally, ventilate the room where
the breakage ocurred.

5. Call first aider in event of injury, who may perform an eye wash if
trained and confident to do so.

6. Call first aider in event of injury, who may perform an eye wash if
trained and confident to do so.

7. Make sure anyone in contact with the glow stick washes their hands
immediately and clear up spillages before continuing. Call first aider
in event of injury.

|=======================================================================
