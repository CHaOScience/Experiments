Useful information

Kit List: 

- Rotating turntable +
- Wire mesh +
- BBQ lighter fuel.

Explanation

Explanation: 

Demo of a flame tornado - a small fire is made at the centre of a
rotating mesh tube. The tube is rotated giving incoming air angular
momentum, so it gets dragged in and makes a cool tornado effect.

Risk Assessment: 

A metal jar lid of BBQ lighter gel is burnt within a 1m high mesh
cylinder that will rotate. As it rotates the flame gets drawn into a
tornado, due to conservation of angular momentum.

*Risks:* +
 +
1. People, and especially fingers, could get burned if they get into the
fire or touch hot surfaces. +
 +
2. The burning liquid could escape, and cause a fire/burns.

*Control Measures:* +
 +
1. Firstly this is _purely a demonstration_ and should not be done
interactively. +
 +
Audience should be kept at least 1.5m away. +
 +
The mesh cylinder is held onto the turntable quite well and acts as a
shield to stop people touching it, and stops the flame getting out. +
 +
The demonstrator should be careful because the lid especially will be
very hot when you come back to it. +
 +
2. Be very careful about where it is set up so there is nothing
flammable nearby. +
 +
There should be a fire blanket close at hand. +
 +
BBQ lighter gel is used because it is quite viscous so will not fly out
too easily +
 +
The jar lid is constrained so it remains central. +
 +
The turntable is constructed so the two halves don't come apart.

*In case of accident:* +
 +
1. Run burned areas under cold water for 10 mins or until it stops
hurting - whichever is longer. Summon a first aider to assist the
casualty. +
 +
2. Smother any flames with the fire blanket. If fire spreads call 999.
In case of burns follow actions in (1).
