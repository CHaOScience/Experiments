CBS 2016 Pollination Talk
=========================

<span class="submitted">Fri, 05/02/2016 - 13:56 — Sarah</span>
Introduction
Pollination! How plants exploit anything that moves!

Useful information
Kit List: 

Several pairs of fluffy gloves, Large number of velcro balls (hooked side), 6 large, straight-sided plastic jars
Fan, Large quantity of hole punchings, Sticky sticks, Plastic sheeting
Straws of assorted sizes, flexible plastic tubing, bottles of 'nectar'

Packing Away: 

Don't throw anything out, we can use it again in future talks!

Explanation

We will add our talk as it's written...

<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
<td>Children with different length straws but same bottle, showing how some pollinators are adapted to certain flower shapes</td>
<td>Have child put on glove coated in velcro and reach into jar to get sweets, get coated in soft &quot;pollen&quot; (velcro balls)</td>
<td>Using a fan to blow small paper circles (&quot;pollen&quot;) onto sticky surfaces (flowers)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Hazard</strong></td>
<td>Bottles of liquid
Straws cut to different lengths</td>
<td>Glove may be scratchy
Jars of sweets</td>
<td>Small bits of paper on floor could be slippery
Sticky flowers</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Risks to audience</strong></td>
<td>Could splash/be dropped
Children may have allergies to sugary drink
Straws could have sharp ends</td>
<td>Being scratched
Getting hand stuck in jar
Allergy to contents</td>
<td>Could slip while leaving lecture theatre
Might leave other surfaces sticky</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Risks to presenter</strong></td>
<td>Could get liquid spilt on electrical equipment
Could splash/be dropped
Straws could have sharp ends</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Could slip while finishing lecture
Might stick to prop</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Control measures</strong></td>
<td>Ensure children are in an area away from wires/electrical equipment when drinking/holding the bottles of drinks
Have paper towel on hand to tidy any spills
Choose plain drink with no artifical colourings/flavourings to avoid allergies
Check when cutting to leave smooth ends, discard potentially dangerous ones</td>
<td>Ensure velcro doesn't go quite to edge of glove so no scratching when putting on
Make sure jar could easily fit adult hand (aids with setup too), warn volunteers of contents, choose sweets least likely to trigger allergies (avoid artificial colourings)</td>
<td>Ensure paper blown into corner away from exit route. Lay out large sheet under area blowing paper to speed up tidying up and avoid paper everywhere
Use double sided tape, not glue, so stickyness cannot come off onto other surfaces so easily. Find a lid to cover with until needed.</td>
</tr>
