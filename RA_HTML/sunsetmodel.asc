Explanation

Explanation: 

A perspex tube filled with a jug of water mixed with about 2-3 pinches
of milk powder. Light is shone up the tube, and the colours of the
sunset can be seen down the tube at different depths of water, and the
blue sky can be seen in the side. The experiment needs to be in the
darkroom. This probably works better in schools than in a public venue
as it does take 10-15+ mins to get all the way through..

The solution works better if it is left to stand for a couple of hours
before you start, so if you can pre-mix some the night before that is
great.

The kids need to be able to see down the tube, so it works better with
the tube on the floor.

This can work brilliantly especially with older kids, here is the way I
do it:

This experiment is quite unusual for ChaOS in that it can actually be
done as an experiment rather than purely as a demonstration though with
a large group the experiment has to be quite directed by the
demonstrator to stop kids getting bored.. I like to start by essentially
saying - "I want you to to find out what happens to the colour of light
as it gets shined through a dilute milk powder solution".

You then get them to fill the tube with the pre-made solution, look at
the colour of the light through different depths of liquid, and make a
table of depth vs colour.

This could take forever, but if you feed depths to them you can speed it
up a lot. You want to distribute them something roughly along the lines
of 0cm, 3cm, 6cm, 12cm, 24cm, 40cm.

You should find that the colour of the light bulb (It is worth making it
clear that you mean the bulb and not the murk at large depths) goes from
white, to yellow to orange, to a dark reddy orange or if you are very
lucky red.

If you then get them to tell you what colours of the rainbow there are
in white light -> all of them, then start from the bottom of the table
and work out what colours are in each colour they have observed (this is
of course a simplification as all the colours will work on exponential
decays but it works well enough).

You should add these colours as an extra column on the table. and end up
with a table looking like:

Depth of liquid

Colour Observed/td>

Colours of the Rainbow

0cm

White

R, O , Y, G, B , I, V

3cm

Whitey Yellow

R, O , Y, G, B , I

6cm

Yellow

R, O , Y, G, B ,

12cm

Yellowey orange

R, O , Y, G,

20cm

Orange

R, O , Y,

30cm

Reddy Orange

R, O

40cm

Red

R

You can then ask which colours you loose first from the light -> the
purples and blues

Where are they going? --> if you look in the side of the tube from low
down at the bottom you should see a bluey tinge to the light coming out.

They are scattering off the little lumps of fat in the milk powder.

You can then go onto ask if they have seen any lights which change from
whitish to red, possibly up in the sky... eventually you may get the sun
as a response

Explaining this is a lot easier with a diagram, and it works better if
you draw it as you go along. Try to get the kids involved in this as
much as possible, by asking them to tell you what to draw, or if they
are competent and you have time get them to draw it.<./p>

Draw the earth, from the top (so north pole in the middle)

Draw the sun off to one side

Ask them what could be getting between you and the sun to change its
colour -> Air

Draw on the atmosphere - it should be relatively thin in reality as
thick as the skin on an apple

Draw the half of the earth in shadow

Mark on sunrise sunset midday and midnight.

Draw a light beam going to someone standing at midday, and draw a little
blue light scattering out

Draw a light beam going to someone at dawn or dusk through lots of
atmosphere-> draw all the blue light scattering out -> leaving the red
-> red sunset just like in the tube

Draw someone near this light beam who looks toward the beam going past -
what colour will they see? -> Blue. What colour is the sky? -> blue. Wy
is the sky blue? -> cos you are seeing the scattered blue light

If you can get this final response it makes up for all the labour up to
then!

A bit more background detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scattering in the sky is actually mostly from oxygen and nitrogen
molecules not dust.

You might like to know that the process by which the scattering occurs
is called Rayleigh scattering (or the Tyndall effect). The scattering
cross-section (in effect, the amount of light scattered) is dependent
upon (wavelength)^(-4). This is a very strong wavelength dependence,
which explains why the blue light (short wavelength) is scattered more
than the red (long wavelength).

Historically, Tyndall and Rayleigh thought that the scattering was due
to small particles of dust and water vapour in the atmosphere. However,
this is not the case - the scattering takes place from nitrogen and
oxygen in the air. If scattering took place off dust, the colour of the
sky would be much more variable. Water droplets in clouds tend to
scatter all wavelengths of light equally, which is why clouds are white.

Why is the sky blue not violet (since violet is even shorter
wavelength)? This is to do with our eyes, which are more sensitive to
blue than violet, hence the pale blue colour of the sky.

[[other-interesting-scattering-related-phenomena]]
Other Interesting Scattering-related phenomena
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dust in the atmosphere can enhance they effect, so harvests are often
associated with good sunsets due to the dusk kicked up, and after the
bunsfield oil depot fire there were some wonderful sunsets in the south
east.

Mountainous regions are often famous for their blue haze. This stronger
than usual scattering of blue light is due to aerosols of terpenes from
the vegetation, which react with ozone in the atmosphere to form
particles of size ~200nm which scatter blue light well. Forest fires or
volcanic eruptions can cause the opposite effect - they can put
particles with a size similar to the wavelength of red light into the
atmosphere, which causes the red light to be strongly scattered
(scattering is best when the particles are the same size as the
wavelength of the light). Therefore we can get effects such as the blue
moon (which is rare!), where the moon appears blue because the red light
has been scattered out.

There is no atmosphere on the moon, so it has a black sky (nothing for
light to scatter off). Mars has a red sky, not due to scattering but
because of dust storms disturbing the red dust. If there has been no
recent bad weather, the sky should be blue, but darker than the earth's
daytime sky because the atmosphere is thinner so less scattering occurs.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Perspex tube filled with water and milk. Light shone in at
one end and scattering observed.

|RISKS |1. Slip hazard +
 +
2. Tube could topple and spill water, which could come into contact with
electrical equipment. Also see Electrical Parts RA. +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Clear up any spills promptly +
 +
2. Use 7.2V light only. Demonstrator to place power supply/transformer
above the surface on which the tube stands. Keep transformer off ground
and away from experiment and possible spills. All surrounding mains
voltage electrical equipment must be kept clear of the ground, or in a
place where it will not be compromised in the event of a major leak.
When setting up experiment, pour water into tube away from unprotected
electrical equipment (over the low voltage, splash-proofed light box is
OK) +
 +
Demonstrator must carefully inspect the light box before starting to
ensure no damage has occured which would affect the waterproofing (for
example cracking of the light window). +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |1. Call first aider in
event of injury. +
 +
2. Turn off electricity at mains. Call first aider. +
|=======================================================================

This experiment is sometimes run in a darkroom, see separate risk
