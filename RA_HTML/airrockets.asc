Useful information

Kit List: 

* Pump +
* Bung with hole or with valve +
* Rope +
* Lemonade (or other fizzy drink) bottle with tube attached for the rope
to run through (something with low friction so that the bottle will come
back down again and fly further). +
* Launch stand

Frequency of use:

Explanation

Explanation: 

Launching lemonade bottle air rockets along a rope (going up at an angle
of 20-30 degrees) - this is a less messy version of the water rockets
experiment which can be done inside in a suitably large hall.

*Setup* +
Set up the rope running from the launch area to a higher point (raising
the launch area, e.g. blocks, can keep the rope above head height) - run
the rope through the tube attached to the bottle. Jam the bung in the
bottle and get kids to pump until the rocket launches up the rope.
Hopefully it should come back down to somewhere you can grab it. Keep
people out of the area where the rope is so that they don't get hit by
the rocket or walk into the rope!

As a further point - it can very occasionally be done without the guide
rope pointing vertically upwards, or without a guide rope at all. This
is suitable in large sports halls or outside only. Here care needs to be
taken that a large enough area is cordoned off so that it does not hit
anyone when it returns to Earth. If a guide rope is not being used, it
can still be helpful to attach a rope to the rocket, in order to limit
its range (such as to avoid hitting people) or to aid retrieval.

*Explanation and Demonstrating*

Like the water rockets, everyone likes to play with the air rockets...
and they can't fail to notice the experiment since it makes a bang every
time the rocket goes off!

If you want to explain the experiment, you'll probably find it best not
to let the kids get onto the launch platform until you've talked to them
a bit. It's generally best to ask a question first to see what they know
already.

There's quite a lot of physics you can explain with the experiment.
Firstly the idea of pressure - you can talk about the pump - put your
finger over the valve and get them to push down on the pump - they'll
find it gets harder as they push down and increase the pressure. So we
have the idea that as we pump the bottle up, we increase the pressure
and this pushes the bung out. If they understand (ask them to explain it
again!) you can talk about molecules. The molecules move at about 500
ms-1, so even though they are light give a good push on the walls of the
bottle when they hit (plus obviously there are > 10^23 of them!). So, as
you pump up the bottle, adding more molecules, there is a harder push
against the wall and the bottle gets harder.

So what happens when the rocket launches? We've said that the bung gets
forced out by the pressure in the bottle (what pressure it reaches
depends on how hard you jam the bung in each time, and varies, and thus
does the height the rocket gets to). You probably don't want to talk
about conservation of momentum with the kids - the bung flies out
backwards with a certain momentum, and thus to give the overall system
zero momentum the bottle gets equal and opposite momentum, sending it up
the rope. You can talk about equal and opposite reactions, though. Think
about leaning on a wall - does it push back on you? Most kids probably
think not. However, if you get one of them to push on your hand, and you
push back, you both stay where you are. If you ask them to stop pushing,
then you fall forwards (or at least pretend to!) - so leaning against
the wall, the wall must be pushing against you! Going back to the rocket
- when you pump up the bottle the air is pushing against the bung - when
the bung pops out it's like stopping pushing against your hand, so the
rocket flies forward. You can show this with throwing a bag of rice; as
you throw it it pushes you back.

You can also talk about energy - where does the energy for launching the
rocket come from, and where is it stored? The more pumping you do, the
higher the rocket goes (all else being equal).

Kids will keep coming back to have another go, so each time ask them
something about it to see what they've remembered!

N.B. A good trick with families or other groups is to challenge them to
get the rocket as far as possible along the string (maybe with only one
attempt!) little do they know that the distance pretty much only depends
on how tightly you put in the bung, and thus the meekest among them can
be the mightiest!

Risk Assessment: 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Fly air rockets up a rope by pumping them up with a
bicycle pump.

|RISKS |1. Hitting people with the bottle +
 +
2. Bottle exploding (slim risk) +
 +
3. Walking into/tripping on the rope which the rocket travels on +
 +
4. Slipping on wet floor if indoors. +

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1a. Keep people away from the
rope (which the rocket travels on) by blocking off any area where the
rope is below head height with chairs, hazard tape or similar. Make sure
the person launching the rocket doesn't lean into its path. Also locate
the experiment sensibly, bearing in mind walkways that people will want
to use in the venue. +
 +
1b. If done without a guide rope, cordon off sufficiently large area to
ensure it lands within it. Check prevalent wind direction as well by
test firing the rocket before people come. +
 +
2. Check bottle for cracks and other damage before use.If a cracked or
damaged bottle is found, it should be cut or marked to show that it is
not for use if it cannot be disposed of immediately. Only fizzy drinks
bottles should be used, as still drink bottles may not be suitable for
pressurising. +
 +
3. The provisions for (1) ensure that visitors are kept away from the
rope. Keep rope ends tucked away and off the ground if possible. +
 +
4 Cordon off area under rope, and keep mop close to hand.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call first aider in
event of injury
