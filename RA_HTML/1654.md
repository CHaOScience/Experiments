Explanation: 

Useful info and set up
----------------------

**What is it?**
"Here I have a model of disease spreading between trees. We can see how quickly it spreads in different conditions and if our efforts to control it actually help."

**Set up**
\[Read through the descriptions of the parameters and get a feel for how changes to each parameter effects the spread of the disease, you can also hover over any of the text within the model for a short description. Don't forget to accept the changes before running a new simulation, or else nothing will change!\]

Set up a fairly basic run of the model

Epidemiology
• Model type = non cryptic infection, no death
• Expected primary infections = 0
• Expected exposed period = 100 days
• Expected cryptic period = 100 days
• Landscape type = random
• Dispersal kernel =100m
• Kernel type = exponential
• Stopping condition = epidemic eradicated (this can take a long time but you actually see the infection end (you can speed up running time)
Weather
• low weather severity
Control
• Disable Control
(second time around)
• Cull radius = 100m
• First survey = 0 days
• Fraction unsurveyed = 0
• Detection probability = 80%
• Survey interval = 90 days
• Expected notice period = 60 days
• Notice variability = 0

**Start by talking about the spread of diseases:**

"How do diseases spread?" - will probably get animal/human centred answers: sneezing, coughing, dirty hands, bad food, bad water, insects, bodily fluids

"What about how diseases spread between plants?" - insects (vectors) are more important, moving the bacteria/viruses/parasites between plants, humans move infected plant material between fields (on farm equipment etc)

\[on computer\] Here we can see a disease spreading between a bunch of orange/citrus trees: Green = healthy, orange = exposed, yellow = infected without symptoms, red = infectious, black = culled. "Can you see any pattern to how the disease is spreading?" - the disease doesn't spread randomly, but trees closer to a diseased tree are more likely become infected. With our model we can change how quickly the disease spreads \[run the model with basic parameters (without cryptic infection), run it again with more initially infected trees, run again changing parameters to speed up spread of disease\] Get the children to change the disease parameters (can split the group into two and use both laptops), trying to spread the disease the fastest. Ask them why they think the model is useful? - can see when the disease spreads fastest/which aspects of it make it most contagious, can see how it spreads through a landscape (which trees are most vulnerable to infection as the disease spreads)

\[on computer\] We can also try out different ways of stopping the disease spreading. "How would you stop a disease spreading?" Vaccination (doesn't work as plants don't have active immune systems like animals) Quarantine (you can't move trees away from each other, and it would be a lot of effort to seal the trees off from each other) Stopping insects (herbicides, this is one of our main ways of slowing the spread of diseases) Culling (stopping the disease spreading away from trees which are known to be infected). Culling is the only effective way of controlling the spread of Citrus Canker, but there are different ways of doing it \[run with control parameters, then run again with new parameters, chat through the differences\] Get the children to change the control parameters, trying to save as many trees as possible, you can make it a competition between the two groups. Ask them why they think the model is useful? - can test how effective different control options are, then can use the results to find the optimal control mechanism, can run the same control plan many times to see how it is most likely to turn out.

\*\*Team Disease vs Team Control\*\*
You can split the children into two teams; Team Disease; who are trying to kill as many of the threes as possible, and Team Control; who are trying to contain the spread of the disease (they tend to enjoy this challenge!)

\[on computer\] We can't always tell when trees are infected. This is called a cryptic infection and makes it more difficult to control the spread of the disease as the infected trees can infect other trees, without being infected. \[run model with cryptic infection - should take longer to bring the infection under control\]

**Explaining the point of computer models:**

\[ probably for older children\] Computers are really useful for biologists. They make it easier to do calculations, work out statistics and can help us predict how a disease will spread.

"Why do we want to know how a disease will spread?" Work out who/what might get infect next, how we can slow the spread of a disease.

"Why is it good to have a computer to do this for us?" Makes it easier (not having to do the sums ourselves), don’t have to infect animals or plants in real life, can put in specifics about our outbreak of disease (where it started, how many people/animals/plants \[organisms, depending on age of child\]) to make it more accurate.

Models simplify reality. To make it easier to understand the disease we can split all of our trees into different 'disease states/compartments', the most simple has just three compartments - Susceptible, Infected and Removed. More complicated models include Exposed and Cryptic Infections (like this model). Mathematical equations describe the movement of plants between the different compartments, the more compartments, the more complicated the equations get, but the more accurate the model gets.

Multiple Runs - \[only for older, keen, kids who want to know more about modelling\]. Each time the model is run (run new simulation) the results are different, partially because the initial conditions are different (two different trees are initially infected) even if the same trees were infected each time, the results would still be different as there are many variables not quantified in the model (e.g. precise landing spot of individual raindrops, wind speed and direction etc) we end up with a different result each time - chaos!(theory).
To get a better grasp on the system you can run the simulation multiple times and watch the results of 100, 200 or 500 simulations run on a series of graphs which show the number/percentage of trees in each category (healthy, infectious and dead) change over time. You can see the typical pattern of infection e.g. that (given the initial conditions that you have set) most times about 250 trees will have to be culled, but that about 5% of the time only 600 trees will be left alive and the disease will run for over 8 years.

Demonstrator background info:
-----------------------------

This is a computer model for a disease called Citrus Canker. It is caused by a bacteria (Xanthomonas axonopodis) and infects orange and lemon trees causing them to drop their leaves and fruit early. The fruit is safe to eat, but too ugly to be sold. It can be easier to model plant diseases because unlike animals plants aren’t going to move around and spread the disease further themselves. The only way that the disease can be controlled is by cutting down infected trees.

**Parameters**

\[Read through these descriptions and work out how they changes to each parameter effects the spread of the disease, you can also hover over any of the text within the model for a short description. Don't forget to accept the changes before running a new simulation, or else nothing will change!\]

Talk through the model parameters in as much detail as you like. Less is more, probably chat through them in stages - run the model without controls to look at the epidemiology parameters, then keeping those parameters the same, introduce controls.

**Epidemiology**
(change how the disease spreads)

Initial infection – how many trees are infected right at the start (in real life this will depend on when the farmers spots that some of his trees are diseased)

Secondary infection rate – how quickly the disease will spread from an infected to an uninfected tree

Typical kernel range – a dispersal kernel is the area around an infected tree which the disease is likely to spread into, shows us which other trees are in danger, the type (either exponential or cauchy (apparently a better model for describing long distance dispersal)) probably doesn't make much difference.

Initial infections - number of trees infected at the beginning of the trial

Model type - different disease scenarios e.g. can it spread before it has been detected (cryptic infection) or not (probably easier to start off without cryptic infection or death)

Expected primary infections - the number of new infections which come from outside the trial (i.e. not from trees that you can see on screen, but the 'external environment') best to keep this at zero to avoid confusion

Expected exposed period - length of time that it takes for a tree to become infected (or how long it needs to be exposed for before becoming infected), once infected the tree can be discovered (as infected but not causing other infections) or start infecting other trees (if there is a cryptic infection period)

Expected detectable period - length of time a tree will be detectable for before becoming infectious

Landscape type - can simulate two neighboring plots of orange trees in a grove or citrus trees across a large landscape

Stopping condition - the simulation can either stop after a set period of time or once the disease has been bought under control (it's more satisfying to let it run until either you or the disease have 'won')

**Weather ****
Citrus canker is spread by in water droplets so it spreads more quickly between plants in high severity (wetter and windier) weather. It 'll be easier to start by keeping the weather the same throughout the trial (go for low severity throughout, you'll have a greater chance of 'beating' the disease)**

Probability that a low/high weather severity index - these two parameters alter the changeability of the weather, if the cursor is to the right for both then the weather will remain constant throughout the experiment, if to the left then the weather will oscillate between high and low

Weather change interval - how often the weather status could change severity

Weather low severity factor - controls the difference in rate of infection spread between low and high severity weather conditions

**Controls**
The main method for controlling Citrus Canker is culling visibly infected trees and a number of the surrounding trees.

Cull radius - all of the trees within this area are culled at the same time as the infected tree. The larger that this area is, the more likely you are to locally eradicate the disease, but you might end up killing all of your trees!

Detection probability - likelihood of spotting the symptoms of diseased trees

First survey - the time point at which the trees are first checked for disease

Survey interval - how often the trees are checked for disease

Fraction unsurveyed - proportion of trees which can't be accessed to checked for disease (since they are on private property or are physically inaccessible), these trees will still be culled if within the cull radius of another tree

Expected notice period - average time between finding a diseased tree and culling it

Notice variability - standard deviation of time between finding and culling a given tree (makes the model more realistic - as you can't guarantee to remove all trees exactly 20 days after finding them)

Cull together - remove all trees simultaneously

Disable control - no intervention, watch spread of unopposed disease
