Explanation

Explanation: 

Things to do +
Basic idea: Attach a piece of paper between the clamps (needs clamping
very tightly), tighten the nut at the end until the paper breaks, notice
the reading on the newton meter just before it does. Then try variations
on the paper, such as:

* Different widths (full/half) +
* Different lengths (should have minimal effect on results) +
* Square holes +
* Diamond holes +
* Rounded holes +
* Full width with small cut; with practise you can actually see the
crack propagating away from the cut if you tune the force really
carefully.

With the holes you can also ask where the paper will break, you should
find that it happens next to a corner or a sharp bend where the paper
was cut badly (if scalpel was used). Children of a sensible age can use
the shielded scalpel/help do up the clamps, though often they're
surprisingly bad at doing them up tightly enough!

What can go wrong? +
Aside from the risks in the RA, there are a few ways in which this
experiment can not work too well unless you're careful to avoid them:

* Clamps not tight enough, meaning that paper slides rather than breaks
- if this happens check that the washers are on the outside of the
blocks. The paper can also slide out if the piece you are using is not
long enough and only a small part of it is clamped. If the length of the
paper is long enough to completely go through both clamps and still have
a bit of over hang you will likely avoid this problem +
* Paper not straight, so it twists and buckles rather than stretches +
* Freak results: In particular when you're dealing with holes, the
results aren't always as consistent as they might be, eg a square hole
can be stronger than a badly cut circular one! +
* Scales decide to reset/turn off mid-experiment. There's not much you
can do but release the tension and start again if this happens.

Things to talk about:

* What are the scales measuring? The reading is in kilograms, but really
it's measuring the pulling force, you may need to persuade the visitors
that a sideways pulling force feels just the same as weight on the
bottom + gravity (can talk about stretching a child/tying a large weight
to their feet if you like...!) With older/brighter children you can talk
about converting to Newtons. +
* Why do the clamps have foam attached to them? If you get them to move
their hands along the surface of both sides of the clamp you can easily
tell that there is much more friction with the foam. If there wasn't any
foam the experiment wouldn't work as the paper would just slide out. +
* Paper is really weak under compression, and tears easily when sheared,
but it is strong under tension. It's made up of lots of long fibres,
thing of it as lots of tiny bits of string, which are strong when you
pull them but collapse when pushed (can compare this to the suspension
bridge if they've already seen that). +
* The breaking point of a full width piece of paper is about the same as
the weight of a typical child in your audience, at 50kg=500N (usually ok
to ask children how much they weigh, don't try this with adults...!) So
you could almost dangle them off a cliff supported on a piece of
paper! +
* When the paper is half the width, there are half as many 'bits of
string', so it only takes half the force to break it. It's often useful
to get a marker pen and draw on the paper to show how the force can be
split across the paper (about 100N in each of 5 sections or something
like that...remember to explain what you mean by a Newton if you use
this terminology). +
* Corners are weak. You can think of all of the force for one of the
sections being concentrated at a very small point, which causes it to
break there. Can make shapes stronger by rounding the edges...circle
perhaps ought to be strongest for given area. +
* When can this be useful? Perforations in toilet paper or 'tear off'
strips concentrate the force in the paper links so it is easier to tear
it.

How is this linked to the real world?

* When you go in an aeroplane what shape are the windows? What might
happen if they were completely square? The de Havilland Comet I was the
first commercial airliner, built in 1949. It passed all safety testing,
and went into commercial use, but there were two catastrophic accidents
that were eventually traced back to the square windows.

* In WW2, almost 3000 Liberty ships were built in sections, and fitted
together later, as a cheap way of transporting massive amounts of cargo
from the US to UK. The problem was that they had square joints, which
tended to fracture in heavy seas, with disastrous effects...12 ships
broke in half unexpectedly for reasons along these lines (trivia:
Constance Tipper of Newnham College was first person to understand why
this happened). Use of brittle materials was also partly to blame.

* There are probably other examples along these lines that
engineers/materials scientists might know, let us know if you think of
any more good ones!

PLEASE REMOVE BATTERIES FROM FORCE METER WHEN PACKING AWAY - the
batteries have a tendency to drain between events

Risk Assessment: 

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|DESCRIPTION |Stretching paper until it breaks.

|RISKS |1. Risk of being hit by paper clamp when paper breaks. +
2. Bolts in paper clamp may be sharp. +
3. Finger trap risk from wing nuts during tightening. +
4. Experiment contains scissors to be used by children. +
5. Shielded scalpel is still sharp beneath the shield, and can cause
cuts if the shield is pushed aside.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN TO MINIMISE RISKS |1. Demonstator to ensure that
children are away from the clamp the first time the paper is broken.
After this children will normally be wary enough, but demonstrator to
remain vigilant. (Energy released on breaking is comparatively small,
since force is applied by tightening a screw and fax paper does not
stretch much before breaking) +
2. Top of bolts which will be moving covered in tape to minimise
potential damage. Demonstrator to replace tape if required. +
3. Unlikely to occur, but be aware of the possibility if kids are doing
the tightening. Warn children to be careful if required. +
4. Don't give scissors to very young children. Supervise children when
they're using scissors. +
5. Don't give the shielded scalpel to young children, show children how
to use it before letting them handle it. If in doubt, keep it to use
yourself.

|ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT |Call a first aider in
the event of injury.
